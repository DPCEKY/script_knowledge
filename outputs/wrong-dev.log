Passage: This past weekend , my family made so much food that there was still plenty of it going into the week . Knowing this , we chose not to make any new food , because we could still eat the leftover food from the weekend . All we would need to do was warm it up on the stove top . The stove is a gas stove , which produces a flame that , in my opinion , cooks food much better than an electric stove . On Monday after getting home from work , rather than making a new meal , my mom took some of the food that we had saved from the weekend and put it into a pan , and put that pan on the stove . She turned the gas on until the burner ignited , and left the heat on until she felt that the food was warm enough . When she ate it , she swore it was as good as it was when it was freshly made .

Passage: Today was the start of Spring , so I decided it was time to get some cleaning done . The first and largest thing to deal with was my apartment flat . I started by picking up any loose items that were not in their proper place . I put as many items into drawers and closets as possible to reduce clutter . I then moved all the furniture so I could clean the floors where the furniture is normally sitting . I vacuumed the exposed floor then moved the furniture back into place with a couple changes in the arrangement for fun . Then I swept the rest of the floor after dusting any surfaces that needed it . Afterwards , I cleaned all the windows , inside and out , and moved to the bathroom . After wiping down all the surfaces in the bathroom with a disinfecting cleaner , I took a look around my flat to assess my work . My apartment was now clean and it felt great !

Passage: My dad is a great cook and one of the things he knows how to cook good is fish . Sometimes he buys the fish from the supermarket and sometimes he buys the fish from the fish market . When he buys it from the supermarket he buys it by the pound and it is usually already cut up into pieces and cleaned up . When he buys it from the fish market he has to clean it out more and take out the bones . Some of the fish he buys still has the head , fins and tail so he has to cut those parts out too . The head of the fish is really good to make fish soup . I like it better when he leaves the scales ( skin ) of the fish as it tastes really good . There are many different ways that he cooks the fish . Sometimes he will fry it in a pan or deep fry the fish and also put some bread crumbs on the fish before frying it . He also bakes the fish in the oven which makes it soft and tender . My favorite is when dad steams the fish a little bit and we eat it semi - raw like sushi . In the summer time dad will also throw some fish on the grill and barbeque it . My mom told me that eating fish is really good for you as it has a lot of essentials vitamins and oils and eating fish makes you live longer and is also god for your brain .

Passage: Yesterday I decided to boil some milk so I could make cottage cheese . The first thing I did was select a pan to boil the milk . I decided to choose the widest pan I had , because the wider pan would let me boil the milk more quickly . It is important to select the right pan , a narrow pan will take longer for the milk to come to a boil and will increase the risk of burning the milk on the bottom of the pan . Once I selected the pan , I poured the milk into the pan , and turned the heat on the stove top to medium high heat . For the next ten minutes , I constantly stirred the milk as it heated , to evenly distribute heat and to reduce the risk of the milk burning in the pan . After ten minutes of heating , the milk came to a boil , so I removed the pan from the heat , ready to use my sterilized milk to make cottage cheese .
Question: Who will drink the milk once it 's boiled ?

Passage: My friends and I love to go to the movie theater . Every Tuesday , the movie theaters have cheap days , where you can go see a movie for $ five , and then buy a drink and small snack for $ five too . So , we check online to see when the movies are playing , and we decide what we will see . Then , once we do that , we all go in the car and drive to the theater right before the movie begins . We park , and get out and stand in line for the tickets . We usually all buy our own tickets , and then go in and order a drink and snack . After that , we all go into the theater , and take our seats . The movie always has previews before the real movie begins , so we have time to talk a little before the movie starts .

Passage: It was a sad day . June 's great Aunt Martha had died a few days ago , and today was the day they would have her funeral . Everyone in her family was dressed nicely , and made there way across town to the funeral home where the service would be held . As the entered the room , there was a strong smell of flowers that made June 's nose ache a little . Her mom signed a book with her and her brothers names , and they made there way into a parlor where other people had gathered . At the front of the room was a casket that was half way opened with Aunt Martha 's body lying in it . The family made there way up to the front of the room to look at Aunt Martha . She looked as if she was taking a nap in her finest clothes . Her make up and hair did n't really look like she used to wear them , but she did n't look scary like June had imagined . They met some family members that were sad and crying , but others were laughing and remembering funny stories about Aunt Martha . They made there way to a seat at the back of the parlor and a few songs were played while the curtains were drawn in the front of the room . When the curtains opened back up , the casket was closed with a large spray of flowers on top . A pastor stood up and said some really nice things about Aunt Martha , and prayed . The curtains closed again and the pastor told the crowd that the funeral would resume at Shady Oak Cemetery . Afterwards , the group of people that had gathered made there ways to their car for the funeral procession to the cemetery . June 's family followed a long line of cars following a hearse with Aunt Martha 's casket in the back . A police man escorted the group of cars , and stopped traffic so the funeral procession did n't have to stop at red lights on the way to the cemetery . As they pulled up to the gravesite , June saw a green tent with lots of folding chairs underneath , and a metal frame around a hole in the ground . The family gathered around the tent as the pallbearers carried Aunt Martha 's casket to the gravesite and placed it on the frame over the hole . The pastor said a few brief words and prayer again , and then Aunt Martha 's casket was lowered into the ground . The family talked a little while , and then drove over to Aunt Martha 's house to have a wake . There they ate food prepared by a local church for the family , and talked about the good times they had with Aunt Martha when she was alive .

Passage: The previous night and this morning before work I noticed I was missing a lot of necessary ingredients for my future meals . I planned out a trip to the grocery store immediately after work . After I finished working I drove over to the store . It was very crowded but not too hard to find a parking spot . Once inside the store , I grabbed the nearest shopping cart and smiled as one of the grocery workers welcomed me in . Once inside and out of everyone 's way , I thought about what I needed . Since I did n't have a list written down , it took me a few minutes . Once I came up with the list in my head , I started to map out a route in my head that would take the least amount of time for me to follow in the store . First , I picked up my deli . They offered me some free samples of the meat I asked for . Then I picked up my bread which was right nearby . At the back wall of the store I found the meat I was going to cook tonight . After that , I grabbed a few extra items that I thought might also be nice later this week while heading towards checkout . Luckily , there was n't a line and this was done quickly . I paid with my debit card and left with all my groceries in a cart , packed them into my car , and headed home .

Passage: Last night I invited some friends over for dinner . I decided to set the dining room table for dinner , rather than have us all eat around the coffee table in the living room like my partner and I usually do . First , I chose the tablecloth . We have a purple tablecloth , a light blue snowflake patterned tablecloth , and a bright colored floral tablecloth . I chose the floral one because I felt it was most appropriate for summertime . Next , I put a cloth napkin at each place and set utensils on top of the napkin - a knife , fork , and spoon . Then I placed a plate at each setting , four in total . I added a water glass at each setting as well . Then I put out the salt and pepper in the middle of the table so it was accessible to everyone .

" Thanks to a lot of experience , I can get that thing moving and get the yard done in just a little under an hour . It 's normal , average , boring . Except this one time .... A cousin had taken our ride - on mower to do some maintenance on it . He had taken it on a Friday evening and had promised it would be back by Sunday evening . He was wrong . Sunday and Monday came and went with no sign of our lawn mower . Tuesday evening came and the grass was up to your ankles . It needed to be cut . We had bought a small push mower to get into the small spaces so we pulled it out . Me , my wife and my mother - in - law took turns pushing that mower up and down the yard for a good two hours . We had one tiny little bit left of the yard when Howard , the cousin , pulled up with the push mower .

Passage: When you work in a restaurant , after the customers have paid the bill and left , you have to clean up the table and prepare it for the next customer . Sometimes it can be very easy if it was only one person , but if it was a large family it could be very messy . All the left over plates , cups and utensils need to be cleared away to the kitchen to be washed . The table top will also need to be wiped down of any food or spills , so it is fresh and clean for the next diners . And if there are placemats they too will need replacing . My favorite placemats are the ones you can color in , especially when they leave crayons on the table for you to use . Once the new place mats are down , a whole new table setting can be done . Often restaurants and cafes will have a special way they like their tables to be set up and its up to the wait staff to make sure that its done that way for every table . It may involve fancy folded napkins , or how the glasses or utensils get lined up . Some times it involves a whole new setting of plates , utensils and glasses and other times the table is bare except for the salt and pepper shakers . But regardless of what the restaurants table set up may look like , the table has to be ready so new customers can come in and enjoy their meal .

The wake was sad , but my family put together photos and a video from my grandmother 's life , and we talked about the good times we remembered . The following morning , we attended the funeral , where my uncle gave a eulogy , the pastor gave a sermon , and we sang some of grandma 's favorite hymns . We then drove in a procession , or long line of cars , to the graveyard , where we said our final goodbyes and cried . Funerals are always sad , but we get to reminisce on memories of good times with our departed loved ones .

I picked American Airlines because I have most of my airline miles with them and I always like to earn more miles . I accessed the American Airlines website and entered the desired dates of my flight . The website then provided me a bunch of different flight options for both my departing and returning flights . I selected the flights that worked the best for me and were the most affordable and I selected them . I was then directed to pay for my flight which I did via my American Airlines credit card .

Passage: The other day , my friend wanted to go outside . I suggested that we go and play tennis . He said that he had some racquets that we could play with , so I told him to bring them . I drove to the tennis court that was at the park and we got ready to play . I brought some balls to hit and he gave me a racquet to play with . We started on opposite sides of the court and practiced hitting the balls over the net . We did a really good job and decided to start playing . We kept score by whoever made two bounces on the opposite team 's court . I did really well and I won over 40 points . That meant that I had one the game .

Passage: I was nervous about a date coming up with a friend later in the week . I wondered what could help me relax and feel better . I thought that a nice trip to the sauna would be good . The thought of the warm steam making me feel cozy seemed good . I drove myself to the closest sauna and payed to go inside . I went into a room first to change clothes . I did n't want any of the clothes I was wearing to get wet and steamy , so I brought a swimsuit to change into . The steam works best when it touches your skin , so you want to wear a swimsuit or a towel . I moved into the sauna room and sat on a bench in the warm steam . It was very relaxing to be in there , like a hot bath . After a while , I left and changed back into my regular clothes . I felt much better and was not as nervous after visiting the sauna .

Passage: It was a cool spring evening and we wanted to have a family get together on the beach around a bonfire . After getting permission from the city , we began to plan the night . First we went to a local man and bought all of the necessary bonfire wood , which is much bigger than the logs that would go into a fireplace . We went to the grocery store to pick up all of the necessary ingredients for a cookout next to the bonfire . We bought burgers , hot dogs , and buns for each . We made sure we had every vegetable available to go onto a burger including condiments and cheeses . We picked up several bags of chips and ingredients for s'mores .

Passage: Yesterday I woke up and decided to wear my favorite cardigan sweater to work . After taking a shower and eaten breakfast I started getting dressed . I put on a pair of jeans and then I reached for my favorite black cardigan . As I began to button it up I realized that one of the buttons had fallen off . Of course I did not want to wear any other sweater , just this one as it was my favorite . I went to my spare room and dug my sewing kit out of the dresser . I found a thread and button that would match and I quickly threaded a needle . I began to methodically move the needle through the holes in the button to sew it back onto the sweater .

Passage: We normally set a menu on Sunday for each day of the upcoming week to avoid chaos during dinner time . Before I leave for the day in the morning , I am sure to put out the ingredients I need for the dinner ahead of time and defrost any meat I may need to prepare the meal . At around five - thirty , I begin preparing the meal . One meal I prepare often is ground turkey meatloaf and seasoned green beans . I mix the ground turkey with some bread crumbs , ketchup , and a bit of egg to bind it . I also lightly season it for flavor . I push it into the loaf pan , and put it in the oven to cook . I then begin preparing the seasoned green beans . I like to use fresh green beans . They may involve the extra work of snapping off the ends before cooking them , but they taste so much fresher . I season them with red pepper flakes and a little bit of lemon juice . When the oven dings , dinner is ready for my family and I to enjoy .

Passage: My hair is dirty and feels oily when I touch it today , so it is time to wash it . I like washing my hair in the shower because it is much easier than in a bath tub . I turn the shower on and make sure the water is nice and warm , but not too hot . I step in the shower and get my hair nice and wet . It is good to use shampoo and conditioner . First , I take some shampoo that I like and rub it onto my head . This cleans the part of the hair that is close to your head and also cleans the skin there that gets oily . After the shampoo is rubbed into my head , I let the water from the shower rinse out all the soap . Once the soap is out , I take some conditioner and rub it into the longer parts of my hair and the ends . This keeps it nice and soft and healthy . I let the conditioner sit in my hair for a while , and then rinse it all out in the warm water . I dry off , and feel better knowing that my hair is nice and clean again .

I figured that our anniversary would be the perfect time to try this ! I went to my local farmer 's market and got the biggest , juiciest oranges I could find .

Passage: I went for a driving lesson when I was sixteen years old . In my town , the driving lesson had to be three separate days of driving for two hours at a time . My driver was very cool and relaxed . Driving for the first time is a very nervous experience so it was good to have such a laid back guy as my instructor . It helped to put all of the worries to rest . I was very nervous at first . But we started driving around town and I got more used to it . In the instructor 's car , they have pedals on their side of the car as well . So that is a comfort knowing that they can take control of the car if anything goes wrong .

Passage: I was invited for a party , and I had a very nice dress that I decided to wear . But when I saw , it has one button missing . So I had to fix it . That button had four holes , so I wanted to fix in such a way that it looks good . So I had to choose exact matching color with my dress . The button was golden . I started to sew it on back side so , the knot will not show up . Then I poke my needle in one of the hole and stretched my thread all the way , then I inserted the needle in to the opposite side of hole . When it went down , I pulled it all the way , and then , got it out from the hole as which was empty so far , and then from above again I will repeat the same thing and insert the thread opposite to that hole .

Passage: Baking a Birthday Cake For an Awesome Nephew It was the day before my nephew 's third birthday . I wanted to bake him a very special birthday cake . He loves tractors and anything related to farms , so I wanted to include that when I decorated the cake . I decided to make a cake with three layers since he was going to be three years old . I started by finding recipes for both chocolate and yellow cake since I knew that those were his favorites . I made the batter for the chocolate cake in one bowl and then the batter for the yellow cake in another bowl . I poured some chocolate cake batter in the largest and the smallest round baking pans since the top and bottom layers would be chocolate . I poured yellow cake batter in the medium - sized round baking pan since it would be the middle layer . I baked all three cakes and then cooled them . After they cooled , I stacked the cakes according to size and I frosted the bottom and top layers with yellow frosting and the middle layer with green frosting . I decorated the top of the cake with farm animals , a small toy tractor and the words , '' `` Happy Birthday Samuel . '' '' I topped off the cake with a number three candle . My nephew was very happy when he saw the cake . He was very surprised that I had baked a cake for him .

Passage: After a day of washing and drying clothes , I gathered aside the items of clothing to be hung up in a separate basket . I wanted to make sure to get rid of any wrinkles in them before hanging them up . I then brought the laundry basket upstairs and brought the ironing board out of the closet . I unfolded the ironing board and got out the iron from the closet as well . I brought the iron to the sink so I could fill it in order to use the steam function . I then brought the iron to set it upon the ironing board . I plugged the iron 's cord into the socket . As I heard the iron start to heat up , I set the first item to be ironed on the board .

Passage: Every month , I have to make sure to always pay all my bills . Being an adult , this is one of the responsibilities you have to do . There are several bills I have to pay each month with money I earn from working . They include : my mortgage , car payment , cell phone , TV / internet , electric , and credit card bills . I set some time aside to check what I owe on each bill . The mortgage is usually the highest . Most bills I can pay online by using my computer . I go the the website , enter an amount , and within a few clicks , it is paid for . My car payment does n't have an easy - to - use online pay system , so for that I use my checkbook . I take a check and write out the amount , who I am paying it to ( the bank ) , and sign my name . I then put the check in an envelope with the bank 's address on it , attach a stamp , and drop it off at my local mail box . It 's not a long , or hard task , but it 's something I must do each month .

Inside the log cabin structure I put some very small tinder as well as some balled up pieces of newspaper . I lit the newspaper and continued adding very small pieces of wood to it . When the small pieces started catching I started adding larger twigs . As smaller pieces started catching on fire I kept added larger and larger twigs and sticks until the big logs started burning .

Passage: First I go to the store and buy bread . For the freshest bread , I get a whole loaf and bring it home to slice it there . I use a bread knife which makes cutting it easier , and cut off just what I need for the toast , leaving the rest whole . I wrap and store the remaining loaf for next time . Then I get the toaster out of the cabinet and place it on the counter , then plug it in . I choose the darkness of the bread - not too dark , somewhere in the middle for flavor and safety - then indicate the slice thickness using the knob on the toaster . I place the first two slices of bread in the slots and press down on the big button , which causes the bread to drop in and the toaster to get very hot . The timer counts down and I pay attention to it carefully , making sure the toast pops up and the toaster turns off .

Passage: Yesterday my wife and I wanted to watch a new movie that had just hit the video stands . I went to the local store which had a Red Box video vending machine outside of it . I looked over the selections it had till I found the one I wanted . I put my credit card into the slot for paying and purchased a copy of the movie to watch . I took the copy from the machine and headed home after stopping at the store to buy some popcorn for the movie . I placed it into the DVD and watched the movie while enjoying the popcorn . The movie and the popcorn were great . When I was done I popped the DVD out of the machine and went back to the store to return the movie to the Red Box video vending machine . It was an excellent experience and I will definitely do it again .

Passage: I sometimes put a gift in a box , if it does n't already have one , to make it easier to wrap . It 's nice to put tissue paper inside the box , too . That makes opening the gift more interesting . After I have the gift boxed , I assemble my wrapping supplies . I use rolled wrapping paper , clear tape , scissors , and ribbon . Next , I unroll some wrapping paper and place the gift box on top of the flat paper . I study it , trying to figure out how much paper to cut off the roll . I do n't want to waste paper , but I also want to neatly cover the gift . Once I decide how much paper to cut off , I mark the place with pencil , then fold there , and cut the paper along the fold line . Now I turn the gift upside down , and position it in the center of my paper . I pull up one end of the paper , and tape it to the center bottom of the box . I pull the other end of the paper smooth , pull it around the box and tape it in place too . Then I do the ends of the package , folding the paper down , cutting it shorter if I must , and smoothing it neatly around the gift box . I tape it in place , and decorate the box with pretty ribbon and bows to distract from any mistakes I may have made .

Passage: Yesterday afternoon , my sister and I went to the outdoor neighborhood swimming pool . The pool requires that visitors either live in the neighborhood or be guests of a neighborhood resident in order to enter , and because we met those criteria , we had no problems getting in . The day was sunny and above eighty degrees . I wore my teal one - piece swimsuit and my sister wore her pink bikini . After we had walked to the pool from our house , we both lathered up with sunscreen and laid our towels and pool bags on vacant lounge chairs . There were only a dozen people at the pool . One of them was my sister 's friend , so she left immediately to go splash around with her and hang out on a raft . I ordered a raspberry smoothie and laid out with my copy of " Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire " while the sun heated my skin . When I started to sweat , I rinsed off in the provided shower and then put on my goggles and got into the pool to swim laps . Thankfully , the lap swim lane was clear , and I got a good work - out in . The day started to cloud over , and my sister 's friend left , so after that the two of us sat in the shallow end of the pool with the warm water rising to our shoulders and chatted until we had both had our fill of pool time . We wrapped ourselves in our towels , put our flip - flops on , and walked home from the pool .

Passage: The last time that I washed dishes , I first rounded up all of the dishes and placed them in the sink . I then went one by one until they were all washed . I first put water on them and then soap and I used the sponge to clean them thoroughly . I lathered the sponge all over each dish and then put them each aside after I was done . After drying each one , I put it aside to dry . Soon after , everything was cleaned and I was able to start putting everything away . I put everyone in the same spot that it always goes in and this continued in this example as well . I let everything dry and I put it exactly where it belonged . This process was somewhat time consuming , but overall , it was a routine and easy process . I was able to wash all of the dishes and feel comfortable using them .

Passage: When my baby was born , I knew I would be learning a lot of new things . She woke up in the middle of the night because she was hungry . I picked her up from her crib and held her close as I walked towards the rocking chair in the nursery . I pulled down the shoulder of my nightgown and unhooked the nursing bra I was wearing so the baby could latch onto my breast and eat . She did n't like having a bottle , so nursing was our best option to keep her happy and fed . She nursed for half an hour and slowly , as she got full , her eyes started to droop shut . I started to sing her a lullaby , soft and sweet , and she soon fell asleep . I wiped some milk from the corner of her mouth with a tissue , and set her back down in her crib so she could sleep until it was time to eat again .

Passage: I love to make hot chocolate in the wintertime . Today it snowed so I decided to make myself a mug of hot cocoa . Some people just put a mug of water in the microwave and then add Swiss Miss. Not me . I use milk in mine . First I put the milk in a sauce pan . Then I put it on the burner on medium high heat . While the milk is heating up I get mix cocoa and sugar together . I have to be careful while boiling milk because once I did it for too long . Then a skin formed on top and it was gross . I learned after that that as soon as it boils I need to pull it off the burner . Once the milk comes to a boil I pour it into a mug . Then I add the cocoa . Then I stir and enjoy it in front of my fireplace .
