of different places.  I picked the one that looked really good to me.  I looked at how much it would cost and how long it would take to get to my house.  When I decided on a shaver, I decided that I would pay for it now and have it come to my house.  I put in my information to pay for the shaver and they told me they would send it to me in the mail.  After about a couple of days, the shaver came to my house in the mail.This past Monday, my family had a small party at my house. One of the main foods that we had to eat were hot dogs. My cousins were the ones who had the idea to eat hot dogs, so they took them over to the house to make. My dad was using our barbecue grill to do all of the cooking, so that's how he cooked the hot dogs. After letting them cook for the amount of time that they needed to, my dad gave the cooked hot dogs to my aunt to prepare them. She put each individual hot dog in a bun and added ketchup, mustard, cheese, and onions. For anyone that wanted it, she also added some of her homemade chili instead of the ketchup and mustard. Everyone at the party seemed to really enjoy the hot dogs, and so did I. Now we know to have hot dogs at any parties we do next time.Last week when I took a trip into the city I had to ride on the underground to get from one place to another. There are stations all around the city, so I had to find the one that was closest to my destination so I wouldn't have to walk too far after I got off. When I got to the station, I walked down the stairs that led into the underground and went over to the kiosk so I could pay my fee. After I paid my fee I took the ticket and went through the turnstile towards the train. I had to wait with a group of people for the train to arrive, but it didn't take very long. When the train got to my station the doors slowly slid open and everyone walked inside. We found our seats and waited patiently for the train to start moving. I didn't take long. Soon, a nice voice came over the intercom announcing my destination was the next stop, so I stood up and waited to exit the train.My sons and I were invited by their grandmother to come for a visit .

Then we sat back and flew all the way to Reno , NV where we were picked up from the airport by grandma .I love to play with my friends, and we play with all sorts of fun and cool toys and games.  When my friends and I are finished playing, we know it is time to clean up our toys.  We all work together to help, and put all the toys back in their boxes, and then we put the boxes away on the proper shelves.  It is important to take good care of our belongings, so we can play with them again another day.  It is important to make sure all the pieces are found, and put back in the right boxes.  It is no fun when someone wants to do a puzzle, and there are pieces missing, or when we want to play a game, but the cards or dice are not in the box!  Taking care of our things, and tidying up after we finish using them, shows that we care about our belongings.This morning I went to my mother to supermarket, to do some shopping for the week, being in the supermarket suddenly remember; That my fish had run out of food for fish, I told my mom and she bought the food for my fish, we first looked for it inside the supermarket, after getting it, we went through the cashier to pay for the food, after paying The food we went to my house, the moment we arrived at the house, I told my mother to let me feed the fish, she told me that if I could feed him, he gave me the container with food and taught me how to give it Eat my fish, first remove the container from the box, I uncover the container that contained the fish food, then with the help of a spoon in the amount I had to give my fish, my mother told me that with three tablespoons of Food was sufficient, paying attention to my mother, take three tablespoons of fish food and throw them into the fish tank, after having thrown my fish was fed with great pleasure and certainly satisfied.One day Courtney was going to the tennis court to play a friendly game with her best friend Vivian. When they got there they got out their tennis balls and tennis rackets, they performed a simple warm up routine by hitting the ball back and fourth. Then the competition really had started to begin Vivian tossed an overhand throw towards Courtney. That really made Courtney mad so she decided it was time to pull out a secret move that she had been working on called: The Mega sword death punch as soon as Courtney had performed that moved on Vivian she could feel the heat coming at her and he knew that she had to get out out of the way of the ball. when Vivian opened her eyes, she could see the ball and her entire side of the tennis court up in flames! Vivian thought it was best for her to go home and wait for Courtney to call her from there. Courtney was left to clean up the mess, but she didn't think twice. She called an uber and went home. She went straight to bed and dint call Vivian again.Sheila walked in the front door of her home. She was all dirty. Sheila said,"I'm going to take a shower now." when Sheila opened the bathroom door she took her clothes off and put them in the hamper. Then she unlocked her iPhone and started to play her "shower" playlist. The playlist had songs like, Witness by Katy Perry, and One dance by drake. When the music started playing Sheila opened the shower curtains and turned on the water. She waited for the water to heat up. Once the water was warm enough for Sheila to take her shower she jumped in and closed the curtains. she sang along to her music and washed her body. Then Sheila was done with her shower, she walked over to the closet and grabbed a towel to dry off with. When Sheila was done. she tooter her iPhone and stopped the music. then she went to her room and got ready for bed.When I woke up this morning, I really wanted to eat some toast.  I walked into my kitchen and made sure that my toaster was plugged into the wall.  Then, I got out a loaf of bread and took out two pieces.  I put each piece into one half of the toaster in the little slots.  I didn't want my bread to be too burnt, so I turned down the setting so it wasn't going to be in the toaster for so long.  I pushed the lever down and the bread started to cook in the toaster.  While it was cooking, I got out some butter and a knife so I could put that on the toast.  When the toast was finished, the pieces popped outside of the toaster, ready to pull out.  I pulled them out and put them on a plate and put butter on both of the pieces.I started talking to this girl on Facebook, she was part of a meme group I belonged to. I found out that she lived in the same state as me only an hours drive away. We had a lot in common and she was definitely flirting with me and I flirted back. I eventually worked up the courage to ask her on a date,  I don't know why I was so nervous (I knew she'd say yes.) I asked what kind of food she liked and she said sushi or Chinese. I was happy because that is also my favorite type of food. we set the date for the following Wednesday, we chose Wednesday because restaurants tend to be less crowded on a Wednesday after noon, and she has social anxiety. Wednesday came and I got up early and did my daily routine. I showered and dressed in my best casual yet classy clothing, put on my favorite cologne and made sure I had my phone, keys and wallet with cards inside. I called her to let her know I was on my way and would be there around 11 a.m. She was super happy sounding and said she'd be ready. I arrived and knocked on the door and was greeted by her in a beautiful and elegant sundress that made her bright green eyes and auburn hair pop. She was amazing. At the restaurant we were both very quiet, but smiled a lot at each other while stuffing out faces with freshly made sushi and egg rolls. I paid for us both and she offered to leave the tip.The baby was in the crib and started to cry. She was crying a lot.   I had just fed the baby, so I didn't know what was wrong.  Why would she be crying?  Then, by the smell, I realized that the baby needed a diaper change.  So I went to the baby, and I slowly took the baby to the changing table. I lied the baby down and took off the baby's pants and took off the old diaper.  Then I got a wipe, and wiped the baby, making sure it was clean.  I then got the powder, and powdered the baby's butt.  After that, I grabbed a diaper from the bag and I put on a fresh clean diaper on the baby.  Then I put on the baby's pants and clothes on and the baby was now happy.  The baby stopped crying and was now finally comfortable.  I then put the baby back in the crib to sleep.It was my one of my roommate's birthdays, and the rest of my friends that I live with and I decided to throw him a surprise party. First, we figured out where my roommate would be while we were decorating our house for the party so that he wouldn't know anything was going on. We decided to decorate everything while he was at work so he wouldn't see. Then, we planned what kinds of activities we wanted to have at the party. We decided to get a pi√±ata, some fun water balloon games for our backyard, and of course, a big cake for everyone to share. On the big day, we decorated our house and once my roommate got there, everyone hid in their places to jump out and surprise him. We yelled "surprise!" and my roommate was so shocked! He was really happy that we had thought of him on his birthday and he loved everything we had planned for his party. It was a great day for everyone.There aren't many inexpensive things to do in Seattle -- and that's especially true if you're a student. Finally, I found something online: a cheap trip to an art museum. I couldn't book online, but I made a note to go in on Sunday. When Sunday came around, I waited in a short line behind a few other people. I paid for my ticket without hassle. Once everyone had their tickets, a guide met us and led the group through the museum. I saw lots of exhibits: paintings, sculptures, pottery, and more. The group eventually split up and I explored the museum on my own. There was so much to see in the museum. Even if I'd stayed all day, there was no way I could have seen all of it. At the end of my trip, I went to the souvenir store and bought myself a few trinkets. It was great!For dinner tonight I decided to cook pasta. I entered my kitchen and grabbed a pot from under the stove. I filled the pot to the brim with water and placed the pot on the stove. I turned the heat on high so that the water would boil. While I was waiting for the water to boil I entered my pantry and chose the type of pasta I would be making. I had various choices such as spaghetti, penne, angel hair and elbow macaroni. I decided on penne. Approximately twenty minutes after I placed the water to boil on the stove the water was at a rolling boil which is perfect for cooking pasta. I turned the heat down on the stove to medium. I grabbed an empty bowl from my cupboard and filled it with penne pasta so I had one serving. I dumped the bowl of pasta in the water. After doing this I added a pinch of salt because it gives the pasta flavor. I took a wooden spoon and stirred the pasta occasionally. After about fifteen minutes I took my wooden spoon and tried the texture of the pasta to ensure it was filly cooked and tender. It was so I grabbed a strainer under my cupboard and placed it in the sink. I took the pasta off the stove and dumped it into the strainer. I bounced the strainer up and down to make sure there wasn't an excess of water. Once there was no more water I put the pasta into a bowl and chose my sauce. I enjoyed my pasta.Last weekend I invited a bunch of my friends over to my house for a barbecue that started around 4 in the afternoon. I was going to cook some chicken and steaks that I had for whoever wanted them, but my friends were also going to bring some of their own food to cook as well. My barbecue grill is in my backyard. Before cooking I put several pieces of hickory wood at the bottom of the grill with some small sticks and paper to get the pieces of wood burning. A few minutes after catching fire the flames went out but the wood turned white and stayed really hot. That's when I knew its was time to start cooking the meat. Throughout the day me and my friends would keep putting food on and off the grill for whoever was hungry while everyone else was either hanging around outside or staying inside to stay out of the heat. I had about 15 people at my house and the last people didn't leave until late in the evening. It was my first barbecue of the summer and I can't wait to do it again.My friend and I left our hotel early, about 6:30. The walk took about fifteen minutes to the station. We had to walk down a long flight of stairs down to the station. We took out our automatic payment cards, walked up to the barrier, and swiped them across the electronic reader. The barrier opened to let us in. We walked up to the map that shows how the different train lines run. We confirmed that we would have to change trains halfway there. We looked at the signs to locate the platform we needed, and walked down another flight of steps to catch our train. We waited on the platform at a safe distance until the train came roaring in. After it came to a stop and the other passengers got off, we entered the train. It was mostly empty and we were able to find seats. At the third stop we got off and quickly walked up another flight of steps to locate the platform for the next train. In two minutes our next train arrived and we got on. This train was crowded and we had to stand. Four stops later we arrived at our destination. We left the train and walked towards the exit.  We passed another set of barriers and swiped our cards again, and then took an escalator up out of the underground to the street.When you eat breakfast, lunch or dinner at home you will find afterwards the plate you used is dirty. So we need make the plate new and shiny again so someone else can use it and it is clean. We take our plate to the sink. We need to fill one side of the sink with warm water. We then will add a little bit of soap. The soap is a special soap just for washing dishes and is usually right by the sink in a big plastic bottle. We will squeeze the bottle and add two or three drops of soap. After the water is warm and soapy we can take our dirty plate and dip it in the water. We will wet a cloth with the warm water and rub the plate until it is clean. We then will turn the faucet on on the other side of the sink and rinse the plate under clean water. When we are all finished we will take a dry towel and dry the dish until it is no longer wet. We then have a clean dish!Last night we had some special guests for dinner. I and my brother helped our mother to set the dining table. First we cleaned the table well. Then we spread a clean table cloth and put an attractive flower vase in the middle. We arranged the vase with fresh, beautiful flowers. Now comes the arrangement of plates. We placed dinner plates, small plates and glasses for drinks for each chair count. Then we arranged spoons on the left hand side and forks on the right hand side of the plates. Then we neatly folded dining napkins and kept near each plate. A stand filled with extra spoons and forks was also kept in the middle of the table. A separate stand with tissue papers were also placed. We sprayed mild air freshner under the table so that our guests could get good fragrance during the dinner time. Our dining dining able is perfectly ready for dinner.I was in my house having a rich pasta, I lifted my glass of water, it slipped and fell on the floor, the water spread quickly, I finished my lunch and got up immediately look for a bucket and a mop, Clean the floor, I noticed that the floor of my house was very dirty, I dry the water then look around and start to mop, collected lots of dirt and dust, then put water in the bucket and some disinfectant, with the help Of the mop and a cloth, I began to mop the whole floor, after a few minutes my house was clean and with a pleasant smell of cherry, I applied a little wax to the floor and I was very bright, After a few minutes the wax dry and I use a polisher, I love to see my super shiny floor, makes me very happy, my House was sparkling and super clean.Washing clothes is a frequent activity that used to be done by hand but now can be done using washing machines and dryers. Some people with lots of children wash clothes everyday. To wash clothes you need to gather all the dirty clothes and use a laundry machine. Some people have laundry machines at home and some people need to go to a wash house to use laundry machines. The wash houses have all different size machines and some take coins and other wash houses take cards. To wash the clothes you have to separate by color so that all the white clothes are together and all the colored clothing is together. Also if you have sheets and towels you want to wash those separately. When you find a machine that is the right size for the clothes you need to wash you add the clothes and then follow the directions to see how much laundry soap you add. Some people use liquid laundry soap and some people use powder laundry soap. You can even do a mixture or combination but make sure to use the right amount. After adding the clothes and the soap you pay for the machine and wait 30 minutes to 1 hour for the clothes to wash. After the clothes are washed you still need to put them in a dryer unless they are delicate clothes that are not supposed to go into the dryer because they might shrink. You take the clothes and put them in the dryer but make sure not to put anything that might shrink. For the delicate clothes you hang them to dry. After you put all your clothes into the dryers it is time to fold the laundry! This is important so the laundry will be nice and neat and not wrinkled. If you have long pants or nice shirts you can put them on hangers instead of folding.I woke up early yesterday morning.  I decided to make breakfast for the family.  First I opened the fridge to see what we had.  We had bacon and we had eggs, so I took them out and placed them on the counter.  I took some bread out of the freezer.  I pulled a pan from beneath the oven.  I placed it on the front burner.  I turned the burner on to medium.  I added 8 strips of bacon.  I let the bacon cook on one side, and then I flipped the bacon.  I allowed it to cook on the other side, and then I removed it.  I placed the bacon on paper towels so it would drain.  I then poured some of the bacon grease from the pan into a aluminum can.  I heated the pan back up, and added the eggs.  I let the eggs cook on one side until the whites were no longer runny.  I placed the eggs and bacon and bread on a plate and served it to my wife.My son needed his diaper changed just a few hours ago. I noticed that his diaper had a distinct smell and felt full, so I carried him back to his changing table. I laid out a disposable diaper in his size and baby wipes. I took off his shorts and his dirty diaper, using it to clean up some of the mess from his bottom. I folded it over so that the outside that was clean was underneath him. I then used the wipes to clean up any mess that was leftover on his bottom. Once he was adequately clean, I grabbed a new diaper and slipped the back under his bottom. I made sure to talk to him throughout the entire process, and gave him a rattle to play with so that he was distracted. I pulled the tabs on the sides of his diaper across the front and secured them around his waist. I put his shorts back on, picked him up, and threw away the dirty diaper. He felt much better and was ready to play afterwards.Yesterday I needed to get across town for a meeting. I stepped outside my apartment and walked to the curb. I signaled to an oncoming yellow taxi that I needed a ride by sticking out my arm and waving. A taxi driver soon stopped there at the curb and picked me up. I opened the back door and climbed into the backseat. After climbing in and shutting the door, I gave him the address to where my meeting was taking place. The taxi driver then drove me to the address I had given him and made some small talk about the weather. When we arrived at my destination, I thanked him, and he told me how much the fare was. I gave him some money, and he gave me change because I gave him more than was needed. I then exited the vehicle and closed the door and headed to my meeting.On some days, when I'm feeling lazy, I'll load up the dishwasher instead of actually doing the dishes myself. I use whatever dishwashing pods or liquid we have at the house to put inside the dishwasher, and I'll set whichever load to wash depending on how much dirty dishes there are. The actual dishwashing process takes some time, so I'll wait around the house while the machine finishes up. After it's done, I'll open it up and pull both racks of dishes out to dry. Once they're done drying, I'll still go over each of them with a paper towel just to make sure that I got any wet spots left behind. Then, when I knew the dishes were completely dry, I would start to put them away. I'd put the silverware in it's drawer, all the plates, cups, and bowls in their rightful cabinets, and all of the pots and pans in their cabinets.Five o' clock is here! It is time to make dinner. We get out the lettuce and tomatoes from the little drawer in the fridge. Then we chop them up into little pieces. Mother gets red meat out of the fridge and puts it in the frying pan. Then she sprinkles spices onto the meat and I hear it sizzle. Sometimes I eat a tomato when mother isn't looking. Next we get out the cheese and grate little pieces off of the big block with a metal thing. When the meat is all done we put it into a bowl. Then we get out the taco shells and put them on the table. Once everything is all chopped up, we take it to the table and call my Dad and sister to eat. "It smells great!" my dad says. My sister doesn't like tacos, but I love taco night! Tacos are my favorite dinner.My sister recently came to visit in New York. Since she loves hot dogs, I decided to treat her to some homemade hot dogs. We went shopping at the  supermarket for the  ingredients. When we got back, it was about noon so we got into the kitchen to prepare the lunch. We had brought some meat , paprika garlic and some celery. After frying the  celery, we mixed it with the paprika and garlic and used it to add flavor to the meat. I stuffed meat into the casings while my sister cut the buns. We then set the sausages to cook in the oven for about thirty minutes. We sat recounting how our mother used to teach us how to cook when we were younger and how she always corrected us when we were wrong. After the sausages were cooked , we put them between the buns. Such a delicious lunch.I planned to go to the shopping centre all week. Finally it was shopping day. I dressed comfortably, made my shopping list and grabbed my purse.  On my walk to the shopping centre  I thought about all the things I would buy. Most of the things on my list were items I needed. A tooth brush, some bread, pencils, socks. I had clipped some coupons and knew I would save a few dollars so that I could get that new game I like. I couldn't wait to see it on the shelf and actually hold it in my hands. I arrived at the shopping centre. It wasn't very busy and I was glad of that. First I did all of my important shopping. And sure enough I had enough money for the game. I rushed to the electronics section and sunk in despair when I saw the shelf was empty. They were sold out of the game I had waited so long to play. The store clerk saw my disappointment and offered me a rain check for when they got more stock in. It would be about 2 weeks' but there was hope. I gathered my things and went home. I marked my calendar for when my next trip to the shopping centre would be... in two weeks. Now all I could do was wait... patiently of course!I was getting really nervous.  My best friend had set me up on a blind date.  I got to the restaurant early so that I could see her walk through the door.  My hands were getting sweaty and I anxiously watched as someone else walked in.  Was it her?  The young woman looked at me and smiled.  She walked my way and called out my name.  I smiled back, relieved that the worst part might be over.  At least she looked like a friendly girl.  We ordered food and talked to each other as we ate.  She and I really had a lot in common!  After dinner, I walked her to her apartment and she gave me her phone number and a good night kiss.  I was so happy!  I wondered how I could have ever been worried when this was absolutely the best date I had ever had in my life!Last week, was my son's birthday, his name is Jamie. I planned a surprise party for him. I put up balloons and made a cake. The quest arrived at noon, many of them brought gifts. I wanted to get pictures of everyone. I got my camera out and asked everyone to gather together for a group photo. They stood very still with smiles on their faces. I brought the camera up to my face, looked through the view hole, and made sure I got everyone in the picture. I pushed the snapshot button and took the pictures. I took a couple of pictures of Jamie when he walked in and everyone yelled surprise. We ate cake and had a good time, then everyone went home. I took the film to the store and they printed out the pictures. I paid for the pictures and left the store. Now, Jamie will always have the pictures of his birthday surprise party.During the summers off I like to go to the beach on my days off.  I will start early in the morning and pack the car with a cooler with drinks and sandwiches, chairs, towels and an umbrella.  I'll drive to the beach and park as close as I can.  Gathering everything up I'll carry it across the sand till I find a nice spot down by the water.  Then ill set up my chair and umbrella, making sure to drive it deep into the sand so it doesn't blow away.  I'll make sure to put on sunscreen before I settle in my chair to sunbath for a while.  And when I am sweating and hot I'll run into the water and swim around to cool off.  While I dry off I'll have a sandwich and something to drink.  I like to listen to the waves crashing and the seagulls. I'll hang out and sun and swim until late in the afternoon before I go home.  Then Ill have to pack everything up, walk across the hot sand and back to my car.  I'll make sure to knock the sand off all my stuff before packing my car and driving home.Ah, tomorrow was the first day of our vacation on the coast. It was time to prepare and get everything together that I would need for the week. I opened up the drawers in my dresser, first pulling out a couple pairs of shorts and one pair of jeans. Then I grabbed some T-shits and one sweatshirt in case it got cold at night. Lastly I got out my socks, underwear, and swim trunks. I got the suitcase out of the closet and unzipped it. In the main compartment I put the pants and shirts I had gotten out. I pressed these down so that everything fit nicely. In the smaller compartment I put the remainder of my clothes. I gathered up my toothbrush, toothpaste, hairbrush and other necessities from the bathroom and put them in a small zippered bag, I then placed this bag in the suitcase. Then i zipped up the suitcase.I'm craving some Hawaiian pizza because pineapple is the best pizza topping and it certainly does belong on pizza. I call up my favorite pizza place which is a general store downtown (I have the number memorized) and let them know I want a large fresh dough Hawaiian pizza with bacon and EXTRA pineapple. The lady on the phone tells me it will be ready in approximately 30 minutes, I thank her and hangup the phone. I make sure to note the time and I leave in about ten minutes even though it only takes seven minutes to drive there. I want to browse the store and buy some chips and soda too. While I'm looking at soda I see my favorite key lime pie flavored soda, it's expensive, but I don't care, because I deserve it. Before the full thirty minutes has passed I see the kitchen staff slide a large pizza box onto the counter clearly labeled "Hawaiian" I make my way to the counter with my chips and soda and proceed to pay the cashier using my debit card. I thank him and he tells me to "have a nice day" I respond with; "I will now!" and "thank you sir" I also turn to the lady who made my pizza and thank her too.When I was a freshman in high school we each had the opportunity to buy an inexpensive tree as part of the Arbor Day holiday . Part of the proceeds for the purchase were going to plant more trees in town . The tree I had was some kind of evergreen tree and I planned to plant it in the front yard . I asked my Dad where it 'd be best to plant it and we picked a spot where there were some flowers , but no trees . In order to plant it I read the instructions that came with the tree and started by digging a hole that was about twice the size of the root ball of the tree . It was a small tree so this was not a big hole . I then tried to make the hole a good shape before putting in some moss and fill dirt . I watered the tree that day and made sure to water it each day for about a week until we had a good rain . The tree grew and became quite large . The one thing I did n't realize is that I should have planned better for how big the tree was going to get because it ended up shadowing over the flower planters a bit .Nobody takes taxis anymore because of Lyft and Uber. Even though lyft and uber are unregulated and probably bad for the economy, drivers, and passengers, they are just so darn convenient. If you take a cab you have to call the cab company and let them know where you want to be picked up. They then send a driver to you. They're supposed to have credit card machines in the cab but often they don't. This means you need to have cash with you. For the fare as well as a tip. So I call a cab and I ask it to take me to the French Quarter. The cab driver says okay and takes the longest route possible so he gets more money. We make inane small talk as he drives until it gets too awkward and then we sit in silence. When we arrive at the destination I overpay him for the ride.Flying in an airplane is necessary to travel to far away destinations that are not easily accessible by other modes of transportation . Last summer , I had a girls trip to the Carribean . We had to plan our trip including booking airplane tickets and booking hotels . We booked our airplane tickets online a few months before to get the best fare . We arrive at the airport a few hours beforehand for an international flight . We all pack lightly with one piece of luggage . After waiting at the airport for a while , we boarded our plane . The flight attendants and crew are friendly . We find out seats and try to as comfortable in the cramped seating of a packed flight full of passengers . We try to relax , buckle up for a four hour flight . During the four hour flight , we can sleep on watch TV or listen to music . And the crew will come around with drinks and snacks . After a necessary flight , we arrive at our destination safely .I was ready to eat.  I was going to sautee some veggies for dinner.  First, I got the vegetables all together.  I grabbed an onion, a bell pepper, some celery and some carrots.  I brought all the veggies to the cutting board on the counter.  I walked over and grabbed my sharpest knife out of the drawer.  I went back to the cutting board and held the onion to the board.  I cut the top and bottom off of the onion and sliced the skin off.  Then I threw those away.  After that, I took the onion and cut it in half.  I started to chop the onion into pieces.  I did the same with the bell pepper.  The carrots and celery were much easier.  I only had to chop little chunks off the ends as I slid the vegetable down the board.  Once all of them were chopped, I threw them in the pot.We are going on a vacation, and I will need to pack some clothes and any other things I will need. I went to the garage, where we keep the suitcases. I picked out one that was the right size for the trip I will take. Not too big, but not too small. Once I had it I brought it back to my room. I needed to bring the right clothes for the weather as well as the activities I would do. I also needed to pack things I need if the weather changes. I folded up several sweaters, as small as I could, as well as a few pairs of pants. I folded my tee shirts and paired my socks. Once I had it all folded and ready, I placed the clothes in the suitcase. I doubled check to make sure it would all fit well. I also packed my tooth and hairbrush on the outside pockets.My friend Thomas was going out of town and asked if I could feed his fish. I said I would of course. Getting into his building was more the challenge. I had to sign in with the front desk, designate my parking place and give my license plate before the door man would let me in the building. I cross the lobby and head upstairs. As I enter the apartment, I see the fish tank. They look happy and very active. The sun is shining in through a window across the room and there is a table next to the tank with a container of fish food. I read the container to make sure I understand the instruction. Thomas said to give the fish two nice size pinches of food. You can't give them too much or it will sink and make the water murky. I try to get just the right amount. The fish get really active when they notice food and immediately start eating. Fish are so easy.When I arrived home from school, my mother told me that the living room was very messy and had many toys on the floor.  Even though my brother made some of the mess, I decided to pick up the toys because I like to feel helpful and I know my mom likes it when the house looks good.  I walked around the room, picking up toys. I tried to pick up a couple similar ones at a time, because I would have to put them in the same place.  I picked up all the LEGO pieces off the floor.  I had started building a spaceship but had not had time to finish.  I put all the pieces together in a bag so that they would be together when I wanted to finish building the spaceship.  I put my brother's action figures back up on the shelf where they belonged.  My mom said I could have a popsicle for doing a good job.I noticed that my alarm clock was not working. The numbers were not showing up on the screen. So I knew it was time to change the batteries. First, I checked to see what kind of batteries it used. It uses one 9 volt battery. Next, I checked to see if I had any 9 volt batteries in the house. I did not, so I knew I had to go to the store. I walked to the store and bought a pack of 9 volt batteries, and returned home. Then, I went to the alarm clock and opened the battery compartment. I took out the old battery and threw it away. Then I took a new battery out of the pack I just bought. I put it in the battery compartment and closed the compartment. Then I checked to see if the numbers were lit up. Then it was time to set the time. I checked my watch for the correct time and pushed the buttons to make the alarm clock the right time. Finally, I set the alarm time to the time I usually wake up and set the alarm for the next day.Before I go to bed at night I like to take a shower.  I will go in and turn on the hot water and while its heating up I will put down a bathmat outside the tub and get my towels.  I will use my hand to check the temperature, and turn on the cold water and to keep the water from getting to hot.  Once its a good temperature I take off my clothes and get in.  I stick my head under the water and get my hair wet and then wash it first with shampoo and then I use the conditioner.  Once I rinse the conditioner out, I was my face with a special face wash.  I like ones that smell like coconut.  I also use a coconut soap for my body and I wash myself down to my toes.  I'll then stand under the water for a few minutes till all the soap has rinsed out, and also cause it feels good.  I keep a waterproof clock in my shower so I don't waste to much hot water standing there for too long so I'll get out after 10 minutes.  I'll stand in the shower and towel off and go get ready for bed.Last night, me and my boyfriend decided that we wanted to go see Superman at the B&B theater. When we arrived, we noticed that there were so many cars in the parking lot and there was a long line at the door to purchase movie tickets. After driving around for 5 minutes, we finally found a parking spot right. When we got to the line, we waited another 10 minutes to get our tickets. Since the Superman movie was in 3D we had to pay extra for our movie tickets. As we were walking to hand in our tickets to the ticket taker, he handed us our 3D glasses to use during the show. Before we walked into our theater, we ordered popcorn, a box of candy, and a large Pepsi. We had to sit in the front row since it was so crowded. After the movie was over, we threw away our 3D glasses into the recycle bin and headed home.One afternoon I was feeling thirsty and decided to make myself a pot of tea. I grabbed my tea kettle and dumped out all the water that was sitting in there and replaced it with fresh cool water. I placed the full kettle on the stove and turned on the burner to the highest setting to boil the water. While the kettle was warming I took out my teas and tea pot. I decided to have green tea that day, and scooped about 5 teaspoons of tea into the pot. Once the kettle was steaming, I turned off the stove and let it cool down a little. I poured the water in the pot and replaced the lid of the pot. When the tea was done steeping, I poured myself a cup into a tea cup that I had warmed up with some of the excess hot water. I poured in some sugar with a spoon and gave it a stir. Then I enjoyed my tea when it was cool enough to drink.I hear the baby is crying, so he must be ready for a bottle.  Very carefully I put my hands under the baby, being mindful to support his neck  with one hand so his head doesn't wobble around. I hold the baby close to me, wrapping his blanket around him and cradle him in my arms.  I speak softly to the baby, I make sure his formula is not too warm and not too cold before I feed it to him.  I test the liquid on my wrist before giving it to the baby. I put the nipple of the bottle in the baby's mouth, and I ensure I'm holding the bottle at an angle so there isn't lots of air getting in his tummy.  The baby drinks all the formula and then I put him over my shoulder,  I then gently patting his back to get him to burp.Upon deciding that a room in the house needs new wallpaper, the family takes a trip to the hardware store. Wallpaper is selected from the designs available. The wallpaper chosen does not need any extra glue because it is the self-sticking kind and they pick this because it is easier to apply. The family heads home and everyone helps in taking down pictures and posters and any other decorations from the wall.  Dad uses water and a scrub brush to remove the old wallpaper. Everyone helps to clean and dry the walls after the old wallpaper is all gone. When the wall is dry it is time to put the new wallpaper up. The back of the new wallpaper has to be wet, but only a little bit. A small amount of water is applied to the back of the paper and then it is time to carefully place the new wallpaper on the wall. Dad uses a step-ladder to reach the high parts of the wall. Mom and dad use scissors to cut some of the paper to fit around electric outlets and windows. After the wallpaper is applied it needs to dry. The family waits for two or three hours then everyone admires the new wallpaper design and puts picture and posters back up on the wall.In our house, we have a guest room that must not have been touched since the 1970's. It is carpeted in tasteless, dirty and old carpet that is begging to be changed. After considering several options, my wife and I decided to rip the carpet up and install some wood laminate flooring. We picked a day on the weekend and invited her father over to help us with the process. First we ripped the old carpeting up and prepared the bare surface to accept the new flooring. We had the flooring ordered and delivered the day previously, so I spent that night measuring and cutting the pieces to size. After the floor was properly prepped, we began laying each piece of laminate one by one. A few spots did not fit quite as planned so it became necessary to cut some pieces shorter than I had initially. Once we finished we took a long break and ordered pizza for dinner.Every week I have to go to the store to get groceries.  First, I take an inventory of the things in my house and make a list of everything I need to make sure to pick up while I'm out.  I then get into my car and drive across town to the store.  I find a parking spot and get out of the car.  I walk into the store and get a grocery cart.  As I walk into the store, I grab a sale flyer and look at the store's sales and specials.  Next, I start going down the aisles at the store, adding things into my cart that are on my list or are on sale and would be appreciated at my house.  After I am done shopping, I get in line to check out.  I wait patiently for my turn.  When it's finally my turn, I check out and pay for my items.  Lastly, I drive home and put away the things I just purchased from the store.I had a long day and I wanted to do something to relax.  It was night time, so I decided to watch a movie.  My cabinet is where I keep all of my movies that I have.  I went over to my cabinet to pick out the perfect movie to watch that night.  I spent ten minutes trying to pick the best DVD to watch that night.  I looked through all of the movies and I finally picked a movie that I liked and went over to the DVD player.  I turned the player on and I also turned the TV on.  I took the movie disc out of the case and placed it into the player.  Then I pushed the movie in.  The menu came up on the TV screen.  I picked to play the full movie, and I started to watch the movie.  I watched the whole movie.Throughout the month, my wife and I get bills to pay for things that we buy or use.  A lot of the times, we get a bill to pay rent and to pay for the electricity and gas that we use to use power and keep our house warm.  When we get the bills, we put them in a nice pile to make sure that we don't lose or forget about any of them.  Once or twice a month, we will sit down and make sure that we pay the bills.  Sometimes we use our computers or phones to log into accounts and pay the bills.  The money comes out of our bank account and we always check to make sure that we have enough of it.  We often will talk about what we can do in the next weeks to make sure that we don't have too many bills to pay.Last week my friend and I went to the public swimming pool nearby where we live. It was a beautiful day outside - a sunny 80 degrees with not a cloud in sight. When we arrived we found an empty spot and put our towels down, along with the items we brought for the day which included some snacks, suntan lotion, books, drinks, and a change of clothes. There were many people there, including lots of children with their parents and some adults alone or with friends. Shortly after we arrived, we put on suntan lotion and took a dip in the pool. It was just the right temperature. Cool, but not too cold. We swam around for a bit and then got out and laid on our towels for a while. We relaxed in the sun and had a nice chat about what was going on in our lives while we ate some snacks. I then took out my book and began to read while my friend relaxed with her eyes closed for a while. I eventually became tired of reading and went in a dip in the pool by myself for a bit. After a few hours of swimming and relaxing in the sun, it was starting to get late so we decided to head home. We put some warm clothes on in the changing room and headed home for the day.On Fridays, my friends and I love to go see movies.  Sometimes, we stay inside the house, and rent movies.  One of the places we like to go to has a machine full of movies called Redbox. We go to this store, and use the machine to rent movies.  When you go up to the Redbox machine, you just press "Rent Movies",  and then it shows you movies you may like.  They even have categories you can pick from, like comedy, drama, suspense, and even scary ones.  Usually, my friends and I pick comedy movies when we watch movies together.  So, once you pick a movie, then you press that button for the movie, and it let's you use your bank card to pay for the movie.  The machine records your card information from your bank, so that whenever you bring it back, it will charge you for how many days you kept it.  It is very cheap to use, and very nice.My family has always wanted to take a vacation to Las Vegas, but we live too far away to be able to drive there. Because of this, our only choice was to fly there. Once we knew that we were doing this, my parent's booked a flight to Las Vegas online. We got ready for the flight one day before by packing all of our belongings that we would be taking in suitcases. The airport we would be using was just a half hour away from our house, so the drive wasn't long. Once we arrived at the airport, we had to step through the metal detectors and go through security so that the airport knew we didn't have any weapons or anything illegal. After security, we went to get our plane tickets, and waited until our flight was ready for boarding. We then gave up all of our baggage so that it could be put on the plane, and we got on the plane.The last time I made an omelette, I was really hungry, but wanted something healthy to eat. It was me and my girlfriend who needed to eat and we both wanted to eat somewhat healthy, while not going out to spend money and get food. As a result, we found eggs in the refrigerator and took out a few for each of us. We then cracked the eggs into a pan, making sure that the outer crust did not end up in the pan. After that, we let the egg stay in the hot pan for around 5 minutes, adding cheese as necessary. As we watched the egg form and stirred it, we started to turn the stove off. Soon after, the omelette was done and we placed it onto a plate with a fork. After this, we began to eat and we enjoyed the amazing cheese filled omelette that we made.Last night, I ordered pizza for dinner. Pizza is one of my favorite foods. I had a couple of friends over, so we decided to order two pizzas in order to feed all of us. My friends and I couldn't agree on which toppings we wanted, so we decided to get one pizza that was half cheese, half pepperoni, and another pizza that was half veggie, half sausage. We looked up the phone number to our nearby pizza place by searching the Internet. We then put a call in and spoke with the hostess, who took our order. She said that the pizza would be ready for pickup in about thirty minutes. We asked if the pizza place offered delivery, and she said yes, but there would be an additional $5 charge. We agreed to pay for the delivery. She told us the total for our bill, and we provided our credit card information and then hung up the phone. Thirty minutes later, we picked up the pizza to take back home.When I was little girl, my friends Tommy, Jessie and I loved going to the pool together.  We would ask our parents if could go to the pool at the gym on the same afternoon, so that we could play together.  Usually, that meant that we would go on Saturdays or Sundays, when our parents were home in the afternoons.  Tommy was a great swimmer, and he taught Jessie and I how to swim and do the back stroke, and even the butterfly stroke.  I was the best at floating, and I always would beat Tommy and Jessie at that game.  I could float better than them both!  I would get on my back and float on top of the water very easily. It was fun!  Jessie had a hard time floating, so she used her floats to help her stay up.  Sometimes her mom brought the large floats we could all get on at once.  We loved those!  We would play horse on them, and also try to knock each other off the floats!Erica and David like to pay their bills together. They pay most of them during the last week of the month. She takes the bills out of the drawer where they had been put away as they came in. He gets out their checkbooks, and they both sit down at the kitchen table to work. One by one they go through all the bills, checking to see that everything is as it should be. The cable bill and the car insurance are in Erica's name, while the utilities and telephones are in David's name. They each write checks for the bills, and then David writes a check for the rent on their apartment. They check each bill one last time, then seal up the envelopes and put stamps on them. Then they walk together to the mailbox to send off the bills. They always hold hands when they walk back from the mailbox.After I have played outside with my sister and rolled in the dirt, slid down the slide and threw balls at each other, we picked up a lot of dirt and sweat that my sister and I just could not wipe clean. We get in the house and decide who should go to shower first. We go to our rooms and peel off all the sticky and yucky clothes and gather our clean clothes and underwear. My sister goes first. She turns on the faucet and sets the water at a temperature that is not too warm or cool. We both know to step in carefully, get our wash clothes and soap. A fresh shower with shower and water we know will wash away all the grime from our bodies and hair. We made sure we had clean towels to dry off.  Stepping out of the shower and being clean and fresh really feels good after a long day of play.Last year, when getting my girlfriend her birthday gift, I felt that rather than putting it into a bag, I should try to wrap it. It was somewhat big so I and needed to purchase a lot of wrapping paper. I went to Target to purchase wrapping paper and then when I came home, I arranged the scissors and tape together so  that I would be ready to complete this task. I then set the gift wrap on the floor and placed by gift around it. Upon doing this, I started to cut the wrap in a manner that fit the gift, leaving some extra. I had a little trouble, but was able to wrap the gift successfully and give the gift. I felt that having extra wrapping paper and the supplies ready and accessible worked to my advantage and helped me complete this task quickly and efficiently. This was a great experience.I had a friend in town from Denver Colorado next weekend and I wanted to plan one dinner out that was really nice.  I was hoping to find a high end seafood restaurant that had availability for us at short notice.  I searched yelp until I found a place that I thought would be absolutely perfect.  The restaurant is called Grill 23.  I thought for sure that they would be booked but I decided to try and book it anyway.  I accessed Open Table on line and submitted my request for Grill 23 at 7:00 on Saturday night.  Unfortunately they were booked so I had to make our reservation for 9:00 instead.  On Saturday my friend and I spent the day touring and shopping around the city.  By the time it was time for our reservation we were very hungry.  We went to Grill 23 and ended up having an amazing dinner.  It was definitely worth the wait.When it was time to clean the floor, the first thing I needed to do was sweep the debris and garbage. I use the broom to sweep the floor from one end to the next, piling all of the dust, dirt and other debris on the floor into a pile in the center of the room. I used a dustpan to collect all the debris, placing it on the floor and using the broom to sweep all of the brie onto the surface of the dustpan. I empty the contents of the dustpan into the garbage then placed the broom and dust pan into the corner. I then made a bucket of water that had floor cleaning solution diluted into it in order to make sites. I took my mop from the corner of the room where the room was, and placed the head of the mob into the water, soaking the head of the mop. Once the head of the mop was completely submerged underwater, and soaking wet, I removed the mop from the bucket and squeeze out the excess water. I then use the mop to wipe over the entire floor. I ensure that all of the stains and stuck on dirt that was on the floor have been removed with the mop, and that the floor looks spotless including when I finished. I rinsed off the mop with clean water, to remove the left over grime and dirt, and placed the mop in the corner. I also emptied the dirty mop water from the bucket, and placed the empty bucket in the corner as well. I then left the room so that the floor could completely dry before I stepped on it again.I was reading in bed last night and my light bulb blew in my bed side table lamp.  I put my bookmark into my book, and got up out of bed and went to the light switch to turn on the overhead light so I wasn't in the dark anymore.  I keep spare light bulbs in my pantry and found the one with the right wattage to replace the broken one.  Once back at the lamp I made sure to switch it off and unplug in.  I removed the shade and saw I must have had the light bulb in for a long time because it was a little dark on one side.  I twisted the light bulb up and out and held it to my ear and shook it like a maraca.  The broken coils bounced around inside and it sound like a rattle.  I took the new light bulb and screwed it in, making sure not to over tighten it so it was seated perfectly.  I put the lamp shade back on, plugged it back in and flipped its switch.  The lamp worked just like new.  I put the old light bulb in the garbage before heading back to bed to keep reading.In the morning, I texted my friend and asked if she wanted to come to the sauna with me. She had expressed interest earlier so I thought she'd want to go. We decided to take Ubers from our houses and meet there. When we got there, we realized that neither of us had brought a towel. Luckily, they had towels at the sauna available for a small fee. We each paid for our visit and included a towel in the purchase. Then we entered the sauna. It was very warm and humid, just like we expected. It was very relaxing. We talked a little bit but mostly we just sat in silence and enjoyed the atmosphere. It was a wooden structure that felt very rustic. Eventually we started to get overheated, and my friend suggested we leave. We got up and exited the sauna. We thanked the workers at the front desk for our visit and then we went on with our day.The first step in taking the underground was determining where I  wanted to go. Then, I consulted Google maps on my phone. I opened the app and typed in my destination. I then selected the public transportation tab and pressed the navigate button. The app told me that I should take the red train to my destination. The station was just a couple of blocks away. I walked there and followed the instructions on the app as to which train to get (red train, northbound). I purchased a ticket at the ticket machine using my credit card. I scanned my ticket, then went through the turnstile. I followed the signs to the correct platform and waited a few minutes to for the train to arrive. When it got there, I waited for the people to exit the train before getting on. The app told me to get off after three stops. Once I got off, I followed the signs to the exit.My husband and I decided that while our son was off at college it would be a good time to renovate his room. It still had cartoony race car trim up and the carpet had seen better days. It's always best to start off with a plan so we sat down a talked about how we wanted the room to look. It is still our son's room when he needs to visit from college so it couldn't be entirely out of his taste. A whiteboard was set up and we made notes about what the room could be after our son finally does move out. An office was the winning choice. We packed everything our son left in the room into boxes and stacked those in the living room. Since DIY isn't really part of our skill set, we shopped around for contractors to help us. They stripped the carpet and trim from the empty room. The painter changed the wall to a warm light grey. When the paint had dried we called a contractor in to put down a nice maroon carpet. The furniture was put back into the room. Afterwards we decided to go through the boxes and only put back the things we were sure our son was keeping. Everything else was left in a box and put in the garage so that our son could look through it when he returned and hopefully throw out some of the junky items.Yesterday when I woke up, I had to do my morning chores that I do every single day. These are my responsibility and I must get them done every day. To begin this process, I made a to-do list for the day. I wrote the items down in order from highest priority to lowest priority. Then I got to work. I fed the animals (one dog and two cats), took out the garbage, did the dishes, and cleaned the cat's litter box. My next step was to start cooking breakfast. I fried the eggs, cooked the bacon, fried the hash browns, and cooked the toast. After my spouse and I ate, I had a few more dishes to do. After finishing up those dishes, I put a load of laundry into the washer. After about an hour or so, the clothes were done washing and they were ready to be put in the dryer. After the clothes were dried and folded, I was officially done with my chores. I could finally relax!I miss one of my friends that lives far away, and think of writing a letter to him. I think about what I would like to talk about. I get out a sheet of paper and pen and begin to write the letter. At the top of the page, I write, "Dear" and then my friend's name to show that this letter is for him. I then write a lot in the middle about things I want to ask him, like how he is doing and if he is happy. I ask about his family and invite him to come stay on vacation sometime. Once I am finished, I skip a few spaces to the bottom and write, "From" and then my name to show that the letter is from me. It's very important to write who the letter is for at the top and who you are at the bottom. If you don't, the person reading the letter might not know who you are, or think this letter is not for them.When I last fed my cat, I had a couple step process. I first put the food in her bowl and made sure that she had an adequate amount of water. I also made sure the food bowl was clean and that it was not overflowing. I had to find the food that I always give to her and open it up before putting it into the bowl. This was easy and I felt like it was routine. My cat eventually came over and started to eat from the bowl. Once it was finished, I did not give anymore, as I give a measured amount of food each time. After  the cat ate all of the food, I refilled her water bowl and left her food bowl there. I also put the food away in the closet and made sure the seal the bag shut. This is a daily routine.I was walking down the street with my phone in my pocket, when it began to vibrate.  I pulled my phone out of the pocket and looked at the screen.  The screen indicated that I was receiving an incoming phone call from my sister.  I pressed the button on the screen marked "accept" to indicate that I wanted to accept the call.  I then lifted the phone to my ear and said "Hello, Sister!" in a pleasant voice.  My sister was calling to discuss the details of our upcoming family vacation this summer.  I confirmed that I agreed with her hotel selections for our vacation.  We chatted for a while, and then she indicated that she had go to an appointment downtown.  I told her that I was glad to have had a chance to have spoken with her, and that I would speak to her again soon.  I pressed the button to end the call and hung up the phone.Last night, I cooked dinner at home for my partner and I. One of my favorite dinners to prepare is lasagna. First, I preheated the oven. Then, I mixed up the filling for the lasagna. The filling contained ricotta cheese, one egg, mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, spinach, and salt and pepper. Then I got a glass casserole dish from my cupboard and coated it with cooking spray so that the food would not stick to it. I then put a layer of tomato sauce on the bottom of the dish. Next I put the dry lasagna noodles and a layer of the cheese mixture I made. I then repeated these steps until the dish was full. I put extra mozzarella cheese on top. I poured a cup of water around the edges of the dish so that the noodles would soak up this liquid while they cooked. I then put the dish in the oven and set a timer for one hour. When the timer went off, I checked on the lasagna. It was ready. My partner and I ate it for dinner and it was delicious.On Monday I usually go grocery shopping, so I decided to make my shopping list in the morning. First, I decided what meals I would make during the week and thought about all of the ingredients I would need to prepare the meals. I looked in my fridge and pantry to see what ingredient I was missing. I made sure to write these missing items down on my list. I also looked at commonly used items, such as milk, bread, and eggs to make sure that I had them. I wrote down anything that was almost gone or completely gone. I then wrote down any household items that I needed, like paper towels and laundry soap. I also thought ahead about any supplies I would need for the upcoming week. I am planning to have friend over this weekend for a cookout, and needed paper plates. I included these on my list. After finishing my list, I read through it and double checked it before taking it with me to the grocery store.Yesterday, my friend said she would call me in the afternoon. I hadn't heard from her in a while, and I was excited to speak with her after so long. She said she would call my landline phone at home. I waited around the house for her call, listening intently for the ring of the telephone. At around 3:30 in the afternoon, I heard the phone ring. I was upstairs when the phone started ringing, and had to run downstairs to get the phone before the call would get to voicemail. I answered the phone a bit breathlessly by saying, "Hello, this is Kathryn." My friend responded that it was her. I greeted her enthusiastically and asked how she was doing. We ended up chatting for thirty minutes, and it was a great conversation! It was fun to catch up with my friend on the phone. After our call, I hung up.I went to a sushi restaurant by myself last Friday. I like to sit at the sushi bar because it is easier to get good service, but the restaurant was very busy, so I had to sit at a table instead of at the sushi bar. A waitress came to take my order. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and the waitress said my order would be ready in about ten minutes. When the waitress brought my order, she didn't bring be a spicy tuna roll, but instead she brought me a California roll. I told the waitress she brought me the wrong order, so I had her take it back.  After about ten more minutes, the waitress came back and apologized for bringing me the wrong order, and she gave me the spicy tuna roll I ordered. The waitress felt so bad she offered to pay for my sushi.John was getting ready to move into a new house. He was excited but needed to do some work on the house before he could actually move in. He decided he wanted to replace the carpets in the living room of his new house so he stripped the old carpet of the living room with his buddies that were there to help him. He pulled up the carpet and got rid of it and made sure the floor was okay. It was fine to work with so he got the padding for the room out of his truck and brought it into the living room. He padded down the floor with his friends. He put it down across the entire room and proceeded to get the carpet out of his truck now. He brought the carpet in with his friends and placed it down across the entire room. He was happy with how it looked with the finished result.My ears started hurting on Monday. By Thursday, the pain hadn't gone away. I was concerned. Immediately, I picked up my phone and made a doctor's appointment. When the appointment came around, I walked in to the reception area. I told the lady behind the desk who I was. She asked to see my medical card, and I gave it to her promptly. Then she gave me a form to fill out while I waited. Finally, a nurse came out and called my name. I went with her through a door to a large hallway. She took my height and weight. Then she led me to a private room. She took my blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and asked why I was there that day. After she was done, she left me in the room alone. I waited. The doctor came and asked me similar questions. He determined I had an ear infection. I left the doctor's office with a prescription for antibiotics. I knew it would make me feel much better!I awoke on Saturday already excited. I was excited because weekends are the only real times where I get to eat a home cooked breakfast. During the week, we are rushing out of the house, and my husband and I are lucky if we have time to shovel a cereal bar down our throats before we leave the house. We walked down stairs, and I began preparing breakfast for my husband and I. I decided on eggs and bacon for this Saturday's breakfast. I crack the eggs on the side of the bowl, drop them in the bowl, and begin whisking away. I always make sure to add a little bit of milk to make the eggs fluffier. I drop them in the pan and listen as they sizzle away. As they cook, I fry up some bacon in a hot pan. I prefer my bacon crispy, as my husband prefers his bacon a bit more tender. When the meal is done cooking, I put it on a plate and we sit down to eat. We take our time and really savor every bits. I love lazy Saturdays.I wanted to have a bog dinner party with all of my friends; so. I a started to prepare a huge feast. I put the big sectional into my dinning room table and went to my closest to get my best table cloth to put over my table. After I covered it just right I brought out my finest china from my cabinet and started to spread the dishes out at each of the seats. I placed each plate in its spot complete with forks, knives, and spoons. Next thing I had to do was get my crystal glasses out so I could put one by each of the plates and fill them with water for my guests. After my friends had arrived and I served them we raised our glasses in a toast to or relationships. We had a lovely meal and they stayed to help me clear the table and put back all the dishes were they belonged.My girlfriend and I decided that we wanted to do something different for a date night tonight.  We looked through possible things to do in the area, and decided on dancing at a swing dancing club.  We got dressed in some nice, but easy to move in clothes, got in the car, and drove to the club.  We had a couple of drinks at the bar while watching the others dance on the dance floor  before joining them ourselves.  When we got on the floor, we danced together, doing spins and dips in time with the music coming from the stage.  We would take breaks in between some songs to cool off and get drinks, before heading back out for more dancing.  Eventually, there was a dancing competition, and we lasted for two rounds before getting eliminated, but we didn't mind, since we had a great time.  We then went home.I was sitting on the couch in my living room when I heard a loud "ding dong!" chime through the house. I got up from the couch and walked to my front door. The doorbell rang again as I made my way to the front of the house. "Ding dong!" Once I was standing at the door, I raised myself up on my toes a little to be able to see out of the peephole. I saw that the person at the door was my mail delivery person. I unlocked the bolt on the door, turned the doorknob, and slowly opened the heavy wooden door and then the screen door. Once the doors were open, I cheerily greeted the mail delivery person and took the mail they handed to me. Once I had taken the mail, I then wished them a good day and I closed the door behind them as they left.Sometimes I love to watch movies with my husband. When we don't have the kids home to disturb us we like to buy a move on demand right from our own living room. The last time we decided to play a movie, my husband went to the "on demand" feature on our TV and scrolled through all the "new release" movies that were available. We both saw a few movies that we wanted to watch, but we didn't want to watch all of the same movies, so we needed to decide on one. We finally decided to watch a movie we both agreed on. He pressed "buy" on the remote and the movie started playing. We both watched the movie in quiet without any one disturbing us. It was really nice. I look forward to having those movie days with my husband since they are few and far between these days.My daughter and I had to go to the airport to get on a airplane to go on a trip.  We got there early in the morning so we could have a lot of time.  We  checked to see if we could still get on the plane on time.  We checked to see if we had our passports which we had to have if we wanted to go on a plane.  We had to make sure we were at the right place because we didn't want to get lost.  We had to find our airplane.  You can get lost on them like you can a bus.  We found it.  We still had fifty minutes so we went in the airport restaurant to get a cup of coffee and a donut.  The donut was delicious.  It had jelly in the middle.  We checked our bags to make sure we had everything then we got on the plane.I was very excited for my birthday party. About a month before my birthday, I helped my mom pick the date and location for my party. Mom called the local fun center and reserved the date. Mom told me I could invite ten friends. I was so excited! Mom got a notebook and I told her the ten friends I wanted to invite. After this, I got to pick my theme! Of course, I chose my favorite movie, Ghostbusters! We went to the party store and got decorations and invitations. Mom looked up my friends' addresses. I helped her fill out the invitations and I even put the stamps on the envelope. After we filled out all of the invitations and addressed the envelopes, we walked to the post office. Mom had to help me put them in the box because I couldn't reach. I am so excited for my party!I recently made spaghetti for dinner. I first got out a large pot, filled it with water, and placed it on a burner turned up to high heat. I also put a dash of salt into the water, since this is supposed to help it boil more quickly. While this heated, I grabbed a box of dry pasta and measured out the amount that I wanted into another container. I poured the pasta into the water once it was boiling. I allowed the pasta to boil for 8 minutes, according to the directions of the pasta box. I set a timer to prevent overcooking. One the timer went off, I stopped it, turned off the burner, and put on oven mitts. I also placed a colander into the sink. While wearing the oven mitts, I poured the pasta and water into the colander. I then removed the colander from the sink and placed the pasta into a bowl so that it was ready to have sauce added to it.I went to the dentist yesterday. I brushed my teeth first, because dentists like that, and I left in plenty of time, so I wouldn't be late. When I got to the office, I told the man behind the counter who I was, and that I had an appointment with Dr. Tsutaoka. He told me to have a seat. I sat in the waiting room and watched the television a while. Soon, a woman came and led me back to a small room with a big padded chair. She had me sit in the chair, and tucked a sort of paper napkin around my neck. Then the dentist came in and smiled and said hi. She asked how I was feeling, and I said I was fine. She told me she was just going to look at my teeth, and she did. She pushed a button and the chair whirred and slowly tilted back. I opened wide, and she looked at my teeth one by one, using a small round mirror on a thin metal stick to see them. She said everything looked good, and I should keep brushing and flossing. I told her I would. She was nice, and I'll see her again in six months.Taking a trip to celebrate a holiday is a wonderful experience.  I decided to take a trip to New York City this year to celebrate New Years Eve with friends.  My first question was if I should stay in a hotel or with friends.  Due to the cost of hotels I decided that staying with friends was the very best option.  I then decided that to travel to New York City my best choice would be to take the train.  The train trip from Boston to New York City is relatively short and it's very convenient because the train stop is very close to my friends apartment.  My friends and I then decided that we should make dinner reservations for a nice new years dinner in New York.  I took care of the reservations for dinner and the train and now I am just waiting a couple of months so I can take this really exciting trip.I felt very hungry so I looked in my fridge for something to eat. A hot dog package caught my eye. It looked tasty to eat and thought it could curb my hunger.  I took out the package and read the instructions for cooking. There are a few different ways to cook hot dogs, microwave, boiling on the barbeque or grill. I decided since I was so hungry already and did not want to wait long I would use the microwave method. I opened up the package and took out a hot dog. Placing it on a paper towel I set the cook time for 20 seconds. It was ready then but very hot. I took out a bun and then spread some mustard, relish and ketchup on it as well. I then placed the hot dog in the bun and eat it all.  It was very tasty and satisfied my hunger.In the morning, I always make sure taking a shower is the very first thing I do for the day. I take off my clothing and get the shower running, so the water will be nice and hot when I go in. Once it's ready, I hop inside and start washing. I take the soap and wash all over my body. I wash my arms, my legs, my back, and my feet. I make sure my entire body is nicely soaped up and cleaned, then I rinse all the soap off. Then, I wash my hair by getting it wet and adding shampoo and conditioner. Once I'm all rinsed off, I'm done showering. I get out of the shower and take my towel to dry myself off. I put on some deodorant, to make sure I keep smelling fresh for the rest of the day. Once I'm all washed up, I get dressed and I'm ready to face my day!As I walked around the house, gathering up all the dirty clothes sometimes smelling them if I was unsure of their dirtiness. Then I separated colors. Sorting whites from colored clothing. Jeans from the more delicate ones. Starting with a load of white as they are usually smaller I start the water before pouring in just a cap full of bleach. Once that load has finished I move it to the dryer, with a dryer sheet to help soften and scent the clothes. Then I place the other clothes in the washer and pour in the measured amount of laundry detergent. It goes through a wash and then a rinse cycle before they are ready for the dryer. I take the whites out the dryer so I can move the next load in. Again a dryer sheet is placed. This also helps remove lint. Check the lint trap clean it if necessary and start drying that load!On Saturday, our family had a party for my uncle's birthday. We went to the store for party foods and drinks. We bought four kinds of soda and three kinds of chips, plus dips and some cut raw vegetables. We had called the day before to order a cake from the store's bakery. We also bought paper plates, plastic forks, and paper napkins that saidI asked someone at Home Depot about this since I've never done it before. They were very helpful. They told me how to figure out how much wallpaper I would need. I had to get a tape measure and measure all four walls. I had to measure how high they were and how wide they were. Then there was this formula where you multiplied the height times the width, divided that by 144 . . . and that's as far as I got. Wallpaper isn't that expensive and I didn't mind having some left over.  So, I just made a guess when I picked out my wallpaper. I can always get more if I need it. I finally got everything out of my bedroom. Other than my bed, the room was totally empty. Then I made a table out of two saw-horses and a board. I opened the package and unrolled a sheet of wallpaper on the table. I peeled the backing off, climbed the ladder, aligned it with the ceiling and affixed it to the wall.I was in the kitchen tidying up and suddenly heard the baby crying from her crib. She must have awoken from her nap. I ran upstairs to hold and coddle her, and realized she wasn't being soothed. I knew she didn't need a diaper change as I had just changed her before her nap and her diaper felt dry. I realized she must be hungry. I brought her back downstairs and opened the fridge to get out a bottle of milk. I brought her and the bottle to the couch, sat her on my lap, and brought the nipple of the bottle to her lips. The baby suckled onto the bottle and I could hear her sucking in the milk. After a few minutes, she released her lips from the nipple, indicating to me that she had had enough to eat. I set the bottle down and placed the baby over my shoulder to burp her.I flipped up the light switch to illuminate my federal, and instantly watched as the lightbulb went on and then immediately shut off. That let me know that the lightbulb was blown, and that it needed to be changed. First I went to the linen closet, and removed a brand-new lightbulb from the box. I went back to the bedroom and turned the light switch back into the off position. I then placed a stool underneath the lightbulb, and climbed on top carefully, with the new label in one hand. Once I was in position to remove the old lightbulb, I placed the new lightbulb on the top of the stool in a safe place, then placed my hand on the blown lightbulb to inshore it was not too hot to handle. Once I realized the lightbulb was cool to the touch, I began to screw the light above in a clockwise motion in order to remove the lightbulb from the light fixture. Once the lightbulb was release, I bent over and placed the old bowl on the top of the stool, then picked up the brand-new lightbulb. I then stood back up so that I could reach the light fixture, and placed the middle portion of the lightbulb into the light fixture. I began to screw the lightbulb in a counterclockwise motion, ensuring that the metal thread of the lightbulb was aligned correctly with the light fixture to inshore that the lightbulb would be evenly inserted into the opening. Once the lightbulb was completely emplaced, then I stepped down off of the stool and back onto the floor, removing the old light bold and the stool from the middle of the room. Then, to check to make sure that the new ball had been inserted correctly, I flicked the light switch from the off position to the on position and looked up to see that the new label of have been illuminated.This morning I decided to do my dirty laundry and to clean my dirty bed sheets. First I took my blanket and pillows off of my bed. Then I grabbed onto my bed sheet and pulled it off of my bed. I crumpled my bed sheet in my arms and carried it to my washing machine. I put my dirty laundry and my dirty bed sheets in the washing machine and added laundry detergent to it. I then set my machine to the correct settings and pressed the button to start the laundry. Now I needed some clean sheets on my bed, so I went to my closet when I keep the clean bedding. I found a clean sheet and carried it back to my bedroom. I unfolded the sheet and matched up the corners of the sheet with the corners of my bed. I laid the sheet on my bed and tucked in the sides of the sheet that were hanging over my bed. Then I put my blanket and pillows back on the bed. Now I had clean sheets!Regina had thought about renting an RV for their family camping trip, and now looking at the car stuffed full of everything her family could think of, she was regretting not getting it. Seeing his wife looking slightly sad, Aaron walked over and hugged her. They stared at the mess together for a few minutes and laughed together. The kids came running back to the car with the various toys and games that a three and five year old needed. Regina asked Aaron to check that everything they had packed was strapped down. As he went to do that, she buckled her little boys in. Then got out her list from the glove box. She went to the back of the car and started checking off things she could see. The grill; check, the kids suitcases; check, her and Aaron's suitcases; check, the bikes; check, propane; check, extra camping odds and ends; check, and her wonderful and adoring family; double check. She smiled as she put the list away and Aaron started the car. They happily sped off on their week away at Yellowstone National Park.I was getting ready to set the alarm so that I could wake up early  the next morning when I realized that's the batteries were dead and needed to be changed. So I took the battery cover off of the bottom of the alarm clock, which is where I saw the the two dead AA batteries. I took the batteries out, one by one, and through the old batteries in the garbage. I then opened a brand-new store-bought pack of AA batteries, and removed two of them from the packaging. Following the direct actions within the battery compartment of the alarm clock, I inserted each of the batteries one by one, ensuring that the positive and negative terminals were facing in the correct directions. Once both batteries were in place and snugly intact, I put the battery cover back on the bottom of the alarm clock in order to secure the batteries in place. I then turned over the clock so that it was sitting right side up and facing me. I push the power button and the face of the clock lit up, with 12 o'clock blinking in red.In the afternoons, sometimes I like to have a cup of tea and relax out on my back deck while reading a book and enjoying some piece and quiet.  First, I went into the kitchen and took out my tea kettle.  I filled it with water and put it on the stove.  I turned on the stove and let the kettle warm.  While the water inside the kettle was getting hot, I looked through my cupboard and pulled out my box of tea bags. I looked through my choices and decided on a peppermint tea.  I then got out a tea cup and put the bag in the cup.  After several minutes my tea kettle started to whistle, signally that the water was hot enough. I carefully took the tea kettle off of the stove, being cautious not to burn myself.  I slowly poured the water into the tea cup and let the bag soak in the hot water.  Afterwards, I took my tea cup out to the deck and sat down with my favorite book.My wife and I decided to invite some friends over.  We wanted to clean our and house and make it look good after it was messed up by my daughter.  One of the first things that we did to clean was to get out the vacuum.  To do so, I opened up the door to the closet and got it out of there.  I took the plug and put it in a socket that was close to the area of the floor that I wanted to clean.  I hit the power button and the vacuum started to make a weird noise.  I opened the vacuum up and cleaned the inside out.  After that, it was ready to get started.  I pushed the vacuum all over the floor in every part of the house.  It was very loud and it was nice to push the power button and turn it off when I was finished.Yesterday I went grocery shopping . I left my house and drove to the store . I parked the car , walked inside and grabbed a shopping cart . I looked at my list and saw that I needed some fresh produce . I picked out the best looking strawberries , they were on sale for $ 2 a pound . I bought several pounds because my daughter loves fresh strawberries . I finished up in the produce section , buying some things to make a green salad later to go with dinner . I then stopped at the meat section and picked out some nice cuts of steak for dinner . I went into the frozen foods section and found ice cream was also on sale . I bought vanilla and chocolate . I went through the rest of the aisles , consulting my list and picking out what my family needed . When I had found everything I needed , and put them in my cart , I walked over to the checkout lanes . I stood in line and waited for my turn . Finally , it was my turn and the checkout person checked me out . I paid my bill , and walked out to my car with the shopping cart . Then I loaded the car up with the groceries , returned the cart and drove home .I was hungry.  It was too early for lunch, but too late for breakfast.  I decided to make an omelette.  I cracked a couple of eggs into a glass bowl and added some seasoning.  I also added a little milk to give it some fluffiness.  Then I whipped up and stirred the eggs.  While I was stirring the eggs, I set a pan on the stove and heated a pat of butter.  When it was hot enough, I poured the eggs into the pan.  As the eggs started to cook, I flipped them and cooked them on the other side.  I put a bit of shredded cheese and diced ham on the egg and flipped it over in half.  I turned the heat down and let the egg cool off a bit.  After a minute or two, I slid the omelette off onto a plate.  It was so very delicious!I had holidays in the last week. It was a long weekend and I planned to watch some movie. My father gave an idea to gather my friends and watch some good movie and he promised to help in playing the movie. I invited some of my interested friends to watch the movie. We discussed and decided to watch the animation movie 'Up'. I went to the shop along with my father to buy the DVD for the movie 'Up'. My father taught me to connect the DVD player to our television. Once the player is connected, I had to insert the disc in the player through the proper hole. Once the disc is placed, I had to switch on the play button to get the movie played. After the movie is finished we have to push the stop button and get the disc out of the player. I learned everything well from my father and played the movie once our friends gathered. We all enjoyed the movie well.My daughter's 10th birthday was coming up in about a month. My husband and I had decided to throw her a party because she was so excited to turn 10 years old. We planned some entertainment for the party and agreed on the food and treats to be served. Then it was time to invite all of her friends to the party. We made a list of her friends with her help. We then looked online for invitations and found a great selection. We let our daughter pick her favorite and ordered 30 of them. When the invitations came we filled out the names for each then addressed the envelopes with only names so that she could hand the invitations out at school. Each invitation explained what the party was for, when it would be, and what to bring and expect. She took the invitations to school the next day and handed them to all of her friends, barely able to contain her excitement. The party was a hit.My old fashioned alarm clock did not go off this morning, subsequently I was late for work. I didn't have time to change the batteries so I waited until after work. Once home, I picked up the clock and used a Phillips head screwdriver to open the back of the clock. Using my finger nail I pulled on each of the two batteries from one side until they came loose. I put the dead batteries in the used battery drawer for recycling at a later date. I grabbed two fresh batteries from the adjacent drawer. I popped the batteries, making sure the positive and negatives were properly aligned and I screwed the plate back on with the screwdriver. I had to reset the time which wasn't hard, I just turned the dial on the back until it was correct. I then reset the alarm as well so that I would not be late from oversleeping the next day as well.This room sure needs and update with a more vibrant color, like yellow. Yes, yellow is the color Max is channeling for this room, but it has to be the right shade of yellow. Off to the hardware store, there is canary yellow, banana yellow, and pale yellow. Decisions, decisions, pale yellow it is and a primer too. Max dust and clear the walls, and covers large furniture. Because, of the existing color the walls will need to be primed before painting. Max fills the painting pan and uses the roller to prime the walls. Using the roller was tough, so Max used the sprayer machine to paint the walls. Hum, hum, hum the machine sprayed forcefully a thin layer of paint, in all there were three layers of paint. The sprayer made the job much easier, and Max was very pleased with the color pale yellow. The walls dried over night and Max uncovered the furniture and updated the room with new pictures, curtains and accessories. Max was very happy with the end results.Last time I played a movie, I was at home with my girlfriend and was somewhat bored. I  was looking for something to do and I knew that neither of us had seen a movie in a long time. As a result, I found a DVD and we watched it. I had to go downstairs to find a comedy movie that would be enjoyable to both of us, since that was the type of movie that we wanted to watch. Once I found the movie, I put it into the DVD player and started to watch. We both relaxed and watching the movie. Later, I had to turn the volume up because we were having trouble seeing. Since we got tired about half way through the movie, I had to set the sleep timer on the TV so that it would not remain on all night. However, we did end up staying awake throughout the duration of the movie.It was the first warm sunny weekend in May, so I was excited to head up into the mountains and camp. I checked through my camping box to make sure I had camp stove fuel, batteries for the flashlights, camp utensils, bug spray and everything else I might need. I also double checked to make sure all the stakes and poles were with my tent. Lastly I loaded up a cooler with food and snacks. I rounded up the kids and we got into the car. We drove half an hour away on the highway before turning onto a Forest Service Road. After about 15 minutes we pulled into a campground. We selected a spot, looking for one that was well shaded and set back from the road. The kids took the tent out and began putting poles together. I helped them stake out the tent. Then we gathered up firewood together and placed it in the fire ring. I got some matches from the box and lit some of the smaller twigs. I poked around the fire until it began to burn well and then started to get out some food for dinner.I wanted to plan a trip to visit my Dad in Maui so decided to go over Thanksgiving because I could stay for longer and would not have to use as many vacation days. I confirmed with him that the dates were OK and started looking at airfare. The best prices I could find consisted of two layovers and included an overnight flight but I was willing to suffer a little bit to save a few hundred dollars. After I booked my flight I gave my Dad the information and he said he would schedule some days off to spend with me. I did some research on things I would like to do in Maui and decided I wanted to go whale watching and possibly snorkeling if the weather was nice. Dad made the reservations since he gets a discount as a resident. I also found some restaurants that I wanted to try. I thought about if I needed to buy anything before I went and decided to pack light and purchase essentials there to not risk my bag getting lost. The trip went as planned and was very relaxing and beautiful.Maria helps clean the table after dinner.  She takes the plates first, scrapes the food off of them, and throws away the scraps. She sets the dishes near the sink. Then, she takes the cups two at a time, and empties them in the sink if there is any drink left in them.  She sets them next to the counter where the sink is to be washed.   Then she gathers the silverware, and any other dishes with food in them.  She wipes the table carefully, and puts back the flower decoration onto the center of the table.  She then goes back to the kitchen, to rinse the dishes, and prepare them for the dishwasher.  She loads the dishwasher with the dirty dishes, and puts the soap in the dishwasher.  She turns on the dishwasher, and goes to tell her mom that she done with the dishes and cleaning the table.Tonight for dinner, I decided that I wanted to make a chopped salad to accompany my dinner of spaghetti and bread sticks. In order to make a chopped salad, I knew that I would need to chop vegetables. First, I decided which vegetables I wanted to chop. I decided that I wanted carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, and iceberg lettuce in my salad. I carefully washed the vegetables to remove any dirt or sand that might have gotten on them. I then got out my wooden cutting board and my chopping knife, which is sharp enough to easily slice through hard foods like cucumbers. I placed the washed vegetables on the chopping board and carefully chopped up the vegetables, one by one. I tried to chop the vegetables so that they were of similar sizes and shapes. I then put all of the chopped vegetables into a mixing bowl and used a mixing spoon to stir them together.Every Saturday my family comes over to my house for dinner. It's very enjoyable seeing all the people that I love. My wife and I cook a large meal with plenty of food for everyone. We all sit at the table and eat and talk and laugh and have a really nice time. Once dinner is over we begin to clean up. We gather up all of the dirty dishes and silverware and rinse them off in the sink and then put them in the dishwasher. After the table is cleared off it needs to be cleaned. So I gather together a clean, dry rag and some kitchen cleaner, and spray the cleaner on the table. I make sure to spray all the sticky spots because they can be harder to clean off. I then take my rag and wipe it over the table, over and over again until the table is dry and completely clean. The table becomes so shiny and bright that it looks brand new. I then put the cleaner away and place the cleaning rag in the washing machine. After this I wash my hands thoroughly and then move on to whatever else is left to do.I was in my kitchen about to cook dinner for my boyfriend and myself. We were going to have steak and some saut√©ed vegetables. I had already put the steak in the oven and was about to begin saut√©ing the vegetables. I pulled a zucchini and a yellow squash out of the refrigerator and placed them on my cutting board. I grabbed a knife from our knife block and began to cut the vegetables. I first cut them into equal sized rounds, but those would be too big to bite so I decided to cut them again. I cut each round in half so it was in the shape of a semicircle. All of my vegetables were cut, but I decided to put one more vegetable in with the mix. I pulled some grape tomatoes out of the refrigerator and put about ten of them on my cutting board. I cut them all in half and poured them into the pan along with my yellow squash and zucchini.I rinsed the fresh wound with cold water, then held pressure on it for a few minutes with a dry paper towel. Once the wound stopped bleeding I gently applied some peroxide and let it dry. I then applied a thin layer of neo sporin. I had to search for band aids and eventually found one in the first aid kit in the car. I found an appropriate sized band aid removed the wrapper and threw the wrapper away. I peeled one side of the band aid sticky cover off, one sticky side exposed,  I stuck it on bare skin just to the side of the wound. I then peeled off the other side and gently pressed the band-aid to my skin, making sure the wound was centered and properly covered by the pad part of the band aid. I tried my best not to get the wounded are and band aid damp over the next few days. I also reapplied a bandage at least once a day for 3 days until the wound stayed closed on its own.I bumped into the corner of the table, and when I look down at my knee, I noticed that I had a scratch and there was blood running from it. That meant that I needed to get a Band-Aid, but first I need to clean the area to ensure I would not get an infection. I used a paper towel, wet it with water, then wiped the area to ensure the Nazi other than my schooling. I then use a kind of all to soak up some alcohol and of by its to the cuts, which had a stinging, tingling feeling. I then got a Band-Aid, and removed the packaging around it. Next I pulled back one of the white strips to reveal bus sticky parts of the Band-Aid, as well as the center cotton so that I could align its with the scratch. Once I placed the center square cotton onto the scratch and insured it was in the place that I wanted the Band-Aid to be, I secured the exposed side of the adhesive part of the Band-Aid, then remove the white protective slip to expose the other half of the adhesive part of the Band-Aid. With both adhesives stuck to my skin, I gave the band they want a final with my finger to assure that it was secure against my skin, and now the Band-Aid was applied.Ouch! I cut myself! When you get a cut, it's very important to apply a bandage to it as soon as possible. I go to the bathroom, where I keep my first aid supplies. The first thing to do is wash the cut. I have to wash away the blood and whatever dirt that may have gotten into the wound. Then, I apply disinfectant. If I don't apply the disinfectant, the germs that are already in the cut could cause an infection, and that could make me very sick. Finally, it's time to put on a bandage. I take a bandage from the box, unwrap it, and stick it right over my wound. It's very important to wrap the bandage tightly, so it stays stuck on my skin. When the bandage gets old and dirty, I carefully take it off and put a fresh one on, applying more disinfectant so I don't get sick. Soon enough, my cut has healed!Around 12 o'clock in the afternoon, I went to my mailbox in the front of my house to retrieve my weekday mail. As I opened the mailbox I saw that it was full, so I grabbed all the letters and mail with two hands. I walked back towards the front door and went inside my house to open the letters I received in the mail. I opened the first letter, then the second, by the third letter I must have gotten distracted and ripped the envelope to quickly. That's when I felt the edge of the paper rip into my finger. Automatically, I reacted and dropped the letter on the table and saw the slit on my finger in which it started to bleed. I headed to the bathroom and in the medicine cabinet I pulled out the first aid kit. I rinsed my finger under warm water and disinfected it with alcohol. Then I patted dry my finger and opened an medium sized band aid to place it on my finger. I peeled the backing on the band aid and place it over the small cut on my finger. I wrapped my finger with the band aid and clean up. Then I headed back to open the rest of my mail.I cut my hand yesterday on a sharp piece of glass, so I had to apply a band aid to keep it from getting infected. First, I had to go into the bathroom and get the package of band aids out of the medicine cabinet above the sink. I took a band aid out of the box and removed the paper wrapper that keeps it clean and sterile. I set it off to the side, then turned on the water in the sink and adjusted the temperature until it was warm. Next, I washed my cut to make sure it was clean, then I dried my hands on the towel hanging above the toilet. I took the band aid and gently placed it over the cut, taking care to make sure that the adhesive stuck to my skin so the band aid wouldn't fall off. Finally, I threw away the paper wrapper that the band aid came in, and left the bathroom to finish my day.I cut myself just enough to bleed, but not enough to need to go to the hospital. I needed to wash the cut and put on a band aid, so it would not get anything dirty in the cut. I went to the medicine cabinet and got out the box of band aids. I also got a bottle of wound wash, peroxide. I held the finger I cut over the sink, and poured the peroxide over the wound. It stung a little, but I did it so I knew my cut was clean. I let the peroxide fizzle then dry for a moment. Once it was dry, I opened the band aid. I had to removed it from the box, then the paper it was wrapped in, the take the pieces of wax paper off the sticky parts. Once I did I held my finger out and used my other hand to put the soft part on the cut. I wrapped the band aid around my finger and picked up all the papers that were on it.I have a problem with picking scabs off of my skin. One of the only ways I can combat this is to apply a band aid over the areas to prevent myself from picking at them. To put on the band aid, I open the wrapper and then take off the two little pieces of glossy paper protecting the sticky adhesive side. I then place the band aid over the spot that I either picked already or want to prevent myself from picking. Once i do that, I throw away all the band aid remnants. The band aid itself is a peach, off-white sort of color -- I hesitate to say "nude" because that implies that everyone has the same skin tone, which is untrue. I usually leave the band aid on for as long as possible, which typically ends up being until I shower next. Sometimes I will use small circle band aids if I do not have a full band aid available.I was working in the back yard and I cut my finger on a piece of sharp wood.  I then headed back into the house and washed my hand to make sure the wound was clean and free of dirt and infection.  After washing my hands and the wound with hot, soapy water I put some ointment on the cut to help it heal faster and keep infections out.  I reached into the cabinet and opened the band-aid box so I could take a band-aid out.  I realized that this box didn't have the right size so being careful with use my non-cut hand I reached into another cabinet and found the right sized band-aid.  I tore open the package, pealed back the plastic, and put it over the cut making sure I put the band-aid on nice and tight.  Making sure that the band-aid was secure I headed back out into the yard to finish up my work.Lucy was outside playing with her new kitten.  She was having such a fun time that she forgot about being gentle with the kitten and she accidentally pulled his tail.  That kitten did not like to have his tail pulled and he scratched Lucy right on her arm.  Poor Lucy, she had a bad scrape and she needed a band aid.  She asked her mother to help her.  They got the band aid out of the box and carefully unwrapped it.  Then Lucy's mother gently cleaned her scrape and applied a little bit of ointment.  They peeled the paper off the back of the band aid and gently applied it to the scrape.  Lucy knew that it was important to keep the band aid on for a few days until the scrape started to heal.  After the band aid was on and she got a hug from her mother Lucy felt so much better!I fell down on my driveway this morning and scraped my knee. It hurt, and it was bleeding a little bit. I went into my bathroom and carefully washed my knee with soap and water. I pat the area dry with a towel. I knew it would be very important to keep the area clean so it would not get infected. Therefore, I applied the antibiotic ointment I keep in my bathroom drawer to the scrape on my knee. I used a cotton swab instead of my fingers, so I wouldn't get the sticky ointment everywhere. I then decided to put a band aid on, to help keep germs out. I tore the plastic backings off the sticky part and placed the band aid on top of my wound, over the ointment. It gently pressed my fingers on the band aid's edges to make sure it would stay in place. After that, my knee felt much better.I was talking to my friend when I accidentally cut my hand. I needed to get something to stop the bleeding and to protect the wound from bacteria. I went to my bathroom and into the medicine cabinet, and I grabbed the box of band aids. I selected one that looked like it was the right size put the band aid box back in the cabinet. I peeled back the strips of paper that enclose the band aid and placed them on the counter. I split open the band aid, revealing the white pad that absorbs blood. I placed it over the wound and then pulled back the two plastic strips that revealed the adhesive. I pulled them snug and fixed the band aid into place. I smoothed the surface out and made sure it was a good fit. I then picked up the trash from the band aids and threw it away.This morning, when I was sharpening a knife, I cut my thumb and needed to put a band aid. First, I went to the medicine cabinet in the bathroom where I keep the first aid kid. I opened up the kit and looked for a band aid that would work for the cut. Some of the band aids were too big, and wouldn't fit on my thumb without hanging over the tip, some were too small and wouldn't cover the cut on my thumb. I dug through the band aid bag and found a band aid that would fit. Next, I washed my hands thoroughly to make sure the cut was clean and then I dried my hands with a clean towel., Then I put some antiseptic ointment from the first aid kit on the cut, to help the cut heal faster and reduce the chance of getting an infection. Finally, with my cut cleaned and treated, I wrapped it carefully with a band aid.While doing yard work around my house, I had an accident with the hedge clippers. My finger  was cut when I picked up the clippers by the blade. The cut was not large so a band-aid would be a suitable fix. I stopped my work and went inside to get one. I went to the bathroom to clean the wound before I applied the band-aid. I scrubbed it with soap and water, and then afterwards I applied some antiseptic. Once clean and sterile, I took a band-aid from the box and took off the adhesive backing. Very carefully, I wrapped my finger with the fresh band-aid making sure it was not too tight. When it was on, I flexed my hand to make sure it would not fall off or get in the way. When I was satisfied, I cleaned up the mess in the bathroom and put a work glove over my hand to protect the band-aid from the work to come.Today I got a small cut on my leg from riding my mountain bike. It was bleeding a bit. I headed home to clean up. I walked inside to the bathroom and gathered some supplies from the medicine cabinet. I grabbed some alcohol, band aids, and a wash cloth. I put soap on the wash cloth and dampened it with warm water. I then gently cleaned my leg up. I then patted it try and took a cotton ball and soaked it with some alcohol. I then swabbed the cut with a circular motion with the cotton ball in order to disinfect it. I grabbed the band aid and opened up the wrapper. I removed the backings to the band aid and placed the middle portion over the cut. I rubbed the two sticky sides on my leg so they would stick. I then put all of the materials away and went on about my day.One day, I decided to make dinner.  I needed to cut an onion to make what I wanted to eat, so I got out a knife, an onion, and a cutting board, and started to cut the onion.  I wasn't paying attention, and I accidentally cut my finger with the sharp knife!  I put the knife down, and went to the bathroom, opened the medicine cabinet, and took out a box of band aids.  I also ran my cut finger under water, to clean it before I put the band aid on.  I took a band aid out of the box, and unwrapped it, so I could put it on my finger.  Then, I dried my finger off, and wrapped the band aid around the cut.  It fit snugly, and so I put the box of band aids back into the cabinet, closed the cabinet door, and went back to cooking dinner.It was a sunny day and my sister and I were outside playing away the day. We decided it would be a good idea to have scooter races. With her on her red scooter and me on my blue scooter, we raced down the sidewalk at top speeds. Before I knew it, she began to wobble uncontrollably in front of me. She tried to jump off into the grass before crashing, but she landed hard on the pavement. I rushed to help her and noticed her knee was bleeding quite a bit. We walked slowly home to tend to her wounds. I took her into the bathroom and washed off her wound with soap and water. I then dried her wound with a clean towel. I reached into the cabinet and found the nearest bandages I could find. I peeled open the band-aid and took off the plastic strips. I put the padded part of the band-aid over her wound and pressed the adhesive down around it. She was ready to race again!I was in kitchen and cutting some vegetables with knife which I just sharpened . I think I was cutting so close to my fingers, and doing multi task, the knife cut my finger. The blood was gushing out, I tried to stop with  water. Then I went to my medicine cabinet, and grabbed a box of band aid. The cut was big, so I was looking for long and wide one, which cover my cut. I found one which has some antiseptic cream on.  I cleaned my wound, and pressed cotton on wound for a while till the blood stopped. Finally when it stopped then I peeled the paper from the band aid, and it exposed the sticky part of band aid. I immediately put the sticky part on my skin adjusting it according to my wound, so cushiony antiseptic part directly falls on my wound and covers it nicely. Then I pressed both side so it sticks to my finger well and wrapped around my finger securely.Carrie came running into the house screaming at the top of her lungs, and collapsed at Laura's still moving feet. "What's the matter baby? What happened," Laura asked as she stooped down to look at the minor scrape on Carrie's knee. "Matty pushed me down on the swing," she said through stained lips. "He pushed me real hard." Carries put her head down in Laura's lap there in the kitchen floor. She swooped Carrie up with a little extra spin just for fun. "Let's go put a cool band aid on it, and you can go show him that all he did was get you a sticker," Laura said to her trying to cheer her up. Carries snuggled tighter to her mom as Laura flipped the bathroom light on. In the medicine cabinet, she always kept Hello Kitty and Power Ranger band aids, just in case of this happening. After cleaning the cut with antiseptic, and kissing her now happy little girl, Laura had put a hot pink band aid with Hello Kitty smiling brightly from Carrie's knee. It wasn't two minutes later that she was right out the door to show the boys how tough she was.I'm feeling thirsty. Fortunately, there's a vending machine that I can get a drink from here. Vending machines are special machines that automatically sell things like food, drinks, and other little things. Today, I'm going to buy a bottle of water from this machine. The first thing I do is put in my money. I put in one dollar, the price of the bottle I want. Then, I put in the number for the water. Every item in the machine has its own number, which you punch into a special pad to order it. Once I press the number, the machine pushes the bottle of water down, where it falls into a slot where I can pick it up from. Some machines instead grab the bottle and carry it down gently, especially of it carries bottles made from glass. Now that I've got my water, I don't feel so thirsty anymore!I recently was at a sporting event and decided I was hungry and wanted to buy something to eat.  I spotted a vending machine tucked in the corner of a stairwell that sold small snacks and drinks.  I approached the vending machine and looked through the glass to decide what I wanted.  I found a bag of chips that I know I like and decided that is what I would buy.  I read the price of the chips was one dollar.  I reached into my wallet and retrieved the dollar needed to purchase the chips.  I looked back into the vending machine and found that the chips were located in the B4 position.  I put my dollar into the machine and pressed the "B" button and then the "4" button.  The coiled metal rotated and the bag of chips fell to the bottom of the machine.  I reached through the door at the bottom and retrieved my chips.I approached the vending machine while pulling my wallet out of my back pocket.  I stood in front of the machine and looked through the glass at all the choices in front of me. Did I want a bag of potato chips or a candy bar?  I decided I wanted a Reese's peanut butter cups. The tag in front of the candy bar said $1.50.  I pulled two one dollar bills from wallet and placed them into the money slot and watched the machine grab and pull them inside.  I saw that I now had $2.00 of credit.  I pressed A7 on the keypad which was in front of the Reese's peanut butter cups.  I watched the circular metal wire rotate and push the candy bar forward.  I watched it drop down to bottom of the machine.  I pushed the wide door open and grabbed my candy bar. I heard two quarters fall into the coin return slot.  I pulled them out with one finger and enjoyed my candy bar.I have an important test coming up. So, I've been studying a lot lately. I was studying at the library last night. I set aside four hours to study. But, half way through, my stomach started rumbling. I tried to keep my mind off of it, but my hunger was distracting me from my work. So, I decided to grab something from the vending machine. I stopped studying, and I want to the lounge area of the library. I was surprised by all the great options available. I could choose both hot and cold items. For example, there were tiny sandwiches which could be heated up in a nearby microwave. There were also ice cream sandwiches. I love those frozen treats. I decided, however, just to get some pretzels. I put some change into the vending machine. There were codes for each item available. I entered the code for pretzels into the computer on the side of the machine. And, my pretzels dropped into the bay at the bottom of the machine. I reached into the bay, and I pulled them out. I ate them quickly. They were delicious. I then returned to my homework.When I was hungry last week for a little snack and a soda, I went to the closest vending machine. I felt that it was a little overpriced, but being as though I needed something, I used the vending machine. First, I put money into the snack machine and entered the code for the bag of chips that I wanted. Soon after, the snack came out. Then, I went over to the drink dispenser and got a soda. I then opened the chips and started to enjoy them, before enjoying the soda. I had a great little snack and the ordering process was efficient. I had a little trouble getting the snack out of the dispenser, but was able to eventually . My chips were good, as was my soda. My soda was also cold and delicious. I enjoyed it thoroughly and was glad that I used the vending machine this time.I work in a library that has very old vending machines in the basement. Today however, we got new space age vending machines. What makes them space age is that they have a much larger selection of items than our old machines. They're refrigerated so they have sandwiches and pickles and items such as that. Another thing that makes them space age is that they take credit cards as well as cash. Today I don't have cash, so I get to go down to the vending machine with my card. I swipe the card and it tells me my card is accepted. Then I choose my item. Peanut M&M's. It's always peanut M&M's. I put in the letter and number of the item. The machine thinks about it for a second then drops my item. I bend over and push open the door at the bottom. I retrieve my candy and skip away.It usually happens a lot where you're staying at a hotel, it's late at night, and you just want something to snack on. This happened to me during my family's most recent stay at a hotel. It was close to midnight, and I hadn't eaten a proper meal in hours for whatever reason. However, I knew that just down the hall from our hotel room, there were vending machines for both drinks and snacks. Knowing this, I got some loose dollars from my wallet, grabbed a room key, and went to the vending machines down the hall. I looked at the options that they had, and eventually settled for a bag of beef jerky out of the snack machine, as well as a water bottle from the drink machine. After getting my late night snack, I went back to the hotel room and enjoyed my beef jerky. I kept the water at my bedside overnight just in case I woke up thirsty.I first found a dollar bill in my pocket. I walked over to the vending machine and looked through the window to make sure I knew what I wanted. There were many rows of candy, snacks, and drinks to choose from I chose a particular candy bar and looked at the letter and number below it. Remembering that letter and number, I put my dollar in the machine, which took my money. I then touched the letter and number on the keypad. The metal arms that held the candy bar in place pushed forward and the machine dropped my candy bar down into a place where I could reach through a door to pick it up. The machine knew that I put too much money in and I heard the sound of coins falling into a slot on the machine, which I used to hand to remove.  I walked away from the vending machine pleased and let the next person use it.I had a break between my classes and was feeling a little hungry. I walked to the library and went into the basement where the vending machines were. I did not want a whole meal, so a vending machine snack seemed like a good choice. After looking through my options I decided that some animal crackers would do the trick and help me feel full and alert before my next class. I put my seventy five cents into the coin slot and punch in A-4, which was the number under the animal crackers that I wanted. As soon as I did the stop on the animal crackers dropped just long enough for one pack of animal crackers to fall down. I reached down and pushed back the lid on the retrieval drawer. Off I went, happy to have found a vending machine and buy the animal crackers that I desired.After my workout today I wanted to get a snacked to keep my energy up; so I decided to go to the row of vending machines that the gym keeps outside the locker rooms. It's usually a hard decision when I get there, there is so many choices of healthy snacks. I searched the rows of energy bars and veggie snacks to find what would give me the biggest boost after my exercise. I made my choice and reached for the change in my bag so I could pay for my taste treat. I put my coins into the slot in the machine until I had enough to buy my snack. I punched in the number of my selection so the machine could do its work. The coil started to spin until my energy bar fell from its slot. I pushed through the flap to retrieve my bar and started to eat.I am so glad there is a vending machine just outside from my Math classroom.  I woke up late and didn't have a chance to eat breakfast it's 10:00 am and I am hungry I need to get food before lunch! At my morning break I head directly to the courtyard and to the  vending machine. I pull the seven quarters out of my pocket, put it into the money slot of the vending machine and push the numbers one, three, six and the letter A.  This is the code for my favorite go to snack, chocolate covered donuts with sprinkles of coconut and almonds. This morning I am extra hungry and have found five more quarters which is enough for a container of chocolate milk.  I reach into the machine and grab my purchased donuts.  I add the five quarters and press the numbers two, four, three and the letter M.  I grab the container of milk and head over to a bench and dig into my snack.There was a vending machine at my dorm in college. I bought from it often.  One time  stands out more than the others, though.  I have collected exactly $3.15. This was enough for a snickers bar, two bags of Doritos, and a pack of jolly ranchers. This was all in quarters, nickles, and dimes. When I got to the machine, after I bought my food, a woman came up to the machine and tried to buy a Kit-Kat.  I didn't know her well, but the machine failed.  The Kit-Kat was left hanging on the edge, almost off.  I didn't have any more money, or I would have helped her by purchasing a Kit-Kat myself.  instead, we pounded on the glass and pushed at the machine. I didn't want to risk rocking it because it was very heavy and would be lethal if it fell.  So, we just stood there frustrated, until someone else I didn't know came up and asked about our predicament. I didn't know this fellow, either. He just hit it once it exactly the right spot, and the candy bar fell down. So she got what she ordered, and we were all happy.We were invited to watch a race for "track team", where my daughter was part of it. It was summer, but I was in hurry and  did not realize to bring anything with me. When I reached there, I was already hungry and the people with me too. I usually do not like to get some from outside, but no choice. So I decided to look for vendors or machine. I saw machines, and they were so many. It made me happy. I had $10 with me. The chips were .50 each and cookies were also.50. They had some drinks which was for .50, but big can and bottles. They were very reasonable. So I entered $10 in slot and pressed  buttons for potato chips, Cheetos, Doritos, and Sun chips, total of $5, and then I got  5 bottles of Gatorade, 2 bottles of water, Fanta, Pepsi. Believe me it was enough for us.While waiting for my husband to get out of work, I wait in the employee break room. I'm not really hungry but I have the munchies because it is late at night. I glance over at the vending machine, its bright lights beckon me to the sugar and fat laden calorie rich foods in their shiny cellophane packaging. "eat me" the say in a silently mocking tone. I rub my pant leg to see if i have any change or dollar bills in my pocket. I feel something crunchy in my left pocket....it's a receipt. I rub my other leg and feel some coins in my pocket. "Yes!" just enough to buy that nutty candy bar and salty bag of chips that I really don't need. I plunge my hand into the pocket of my blue jeans and dig out several quarters and a few nickels and dimes. Shoving the change into the machine I press b5 for my first selection, and then I shove several more coins into the coin slot and press d2 for my second selection. each time the coil in the machine spins, effectively pushing the pre-packaged food item off of its cliff int of he bottom of the vending machine where I can reach in a grab my snacks.Billy and Tim love to get bubble gum and candy from a  vending machine at the convenience store at the end of the street where they live. Bobby and Tim usually jump on their bikes and ride down to the little convenience store.  When they get there, they park their bikes, and walk in straight to the vending  machine.  They put in their 10 cent dime into the machine, and press the button next to the candy or gum they want.  The candy pops out  of the bottom of the vending machine, and they usually get two pieces of candy each. They put the candy into their sack they brought with them, and walk around the store to see if they need anything else. Sometimes they also buy a drink for the way back home, especially if it is hot outside. As they leave the store, they wave to the lady at the counter, and thank her for her help.Last Tuesday was another typical workday. Following my daily 1:00 meeting, I was struck with some hunger pains. I reached into my pocket and felt around - fortunately I had some spare change. I stood up from my desk with a smile on my face and started to make my way down the hall. It was the perfect time for an afternoon snack. What would I want? There were so many options. I could opt for something healthy, maybe a granola or a kind bar. Or maybe, perhaps, it was the perfect time to indulge in some chocolate. On the other hand, I could always play it safe and get some popcorn or even some potato chips. I arrived at the vending machine and glanced at my options. Fully stocked! What luck! My eyes scanned each row and column carefully, paying full attention to the grumbles of my stomach. Finally, I came to E6 - the double twix bar. I felt my hunger pang immediately. Ladies and gentleman, we have a winner. I dug into my pocked and pulled out four quarters, and hastily jammed them into the machine. The twix fell down and not wasting any time I grabbed for it, ready to take a bite and get on with my day.There are a lot of vending machines where I live, and so I buy from them from time to time. Buying from a vending machine is easy when it is working. The last place I bought from a vending machine was at my school, it sells little snacks and drinks so that I don't get hungry. I walked up to the vending machine and put my money in, I had 2 dollars. After I put in the money I looked at all the choices in the machine, there was candy, nuts, crackers, and gum. I decided I wanted some candy and so I looked at what number it was and typed the number into the vending machine's key pad. The vending machine took the candy and dispensed it for me and it fell to the bottom where I was able to pick it up. I then got my change back.I took my little boy downtown to stay in a hotel last week. It was a bit of a staycation in our own city. We explored the city during the day. I packed some food for us to eat in the room for dinner, so we would not have to eat all of our meals out. After we finished eating our dinner, my son wanted a snack. But he did not want any that I brought with us. We decided to go explore for a vending machine. We headed down the hallway and followed the sign to the ice and vending. He could not believe all the choices that were right there in the machine. he could choose from different types of candy, several chip flavors and even pop tarts. He decided on a pack of M&Ms chocolate candy. I showed him how to put the dollar into the slot and he loved seeing it get zipped inside. He pushed the letter and number combo for his snack and watched the spring turn around until his candy dropped. He pushed the door and got his snack. he was very entertained with the process.I am really thirsty and hungry so I need to buy something from the vending machine while shopping. I needed to find a vending machine that both sold soft drinks and food. I found 2 machines side by side that one sold drinks and the other sold food. I looked at the food selections and they had mostly chips and candy. I decided on buying chips. I decided on sour cream and onion chips. They cost $1.00 so I looked in my wallet to make sure I had enough money to buy it. I found 4 quarters and put them in. I pressed the number for the sour cream and onion chips and thankfully they came right out. I then moved on to the drink machine. I really wanted a Dr. Pepper. Thankfully this machine had it. The drinks costs $1.50. I took out a dollar from my wallet and 50 cents. Put the money in the machine and pressed the button for Dr. Pepper. Out came the Dr. Pepper, which was super cold and oh so good. I loved my snacks from the vending machine.I was super hungry between classes.  I had skipped lunch again.  I know that was a bad idea, but I used my lunch period to study.  Now my stomach was grumbling.  I walked down the hall to the vending machine near the office.  I knew there had to be something there that would hold me off till I got home.  I smiled when I saw my favorite snack.  I reached down into my pocket and pulled out a dollar bill.  The machine wouldn't take my dollar though!  A girl passing by traded my dollar for a crisper one.  I tried again.  This time I was successful and the sugary goodness would be all mine!  I pressed the number on the keypad that corresponded with the snack I wanted.  It slowly edged toward me and dropped down.  I reached down to pick up my food.  I thought I deserved it now.This afternoon at work, I got hungry for a snack. I didn't have time to go out to a store or a cafe to buy anything, so I decided to just go to the vending machine. The vending machine had many options to choose from. I decided I did not want anything sweet. I would rather eat something salty. The vending machine had a few different flavors of potato chips, such as original, sour cream and onion, cheddar and sour cream, and barbecue. The vending machine also contained other types of salty snacks such as Sun Chips, Doritos, Cheez Its, Goldfish, and Ritz Bits. I ended up choosing the sour cream and onion potato chips. They cost $1. I inserted a dollar bill, pressed the button that corresponded to the chips I wanted, and watched the machine retrieve the bag of chips for me. I reached into the slot to take the chips. I then enjoyed my snack.We decided that Friday night is our bowling night. We already all have our shoes, and don't have to get anxious about renting shoes. Renting bowling shoes gives me nightmares. We arrived at the bowling alley and it was packed, but we already made our reservations, and our lane is nicely prepped for us. All clean.  This alley also has a eatery inside, so the waitress came over to see if we wanted to order anything. We ordered deep fried calamari, onion rings, and cold stouts all around. Waitress came back with out food and drinks pretty quick, in about 15 minutes., I thought it would be longer given how packed it was. This game is not going in my favor. I keep getting splits. and missing the strikes. I need to score some strikes to stay in the game, otherwise, I might have to pay for this entire outing. Woe is me.Last week I went bowling to celebrate my friend's birthday. The bowling alley was called Barney's Bowl-o-rama. When we got to the bowling alley we all went up to the counter at the front of the building to pay the fee and get our bowling shoes. I told the attendant my shoe size and he handed over my shoes, then I handed him the money. After we had all gotten our shoes we headed over to the lane that we had been assigned. Everyone put on their shoes and walked over to the ball storage rack to select our bowling balls. I picked a purple ball and my friend picked a pink one. Someone else picked a green one! After everyone had their balls we sat down to figure out the order in which we would bowl. We all wrote our names down on the scorecard and I was assigned to be the person to keep score. We had a great night taking turns bowling, and my friend had the highest score at the end! When we were done, we all turned in our shoes at the counter, said goodbye, and went home to eat dinner.My friends and I decided to go bowling a few weeks ago. We met up at the local bowling alley around 6PM and walked inside together. The place was packed, but we managed to find a free lane and sat down. A few of us went up to the counter to pay for a few games for each person. We each then went up to the rental counter to rent some bowling shoes. We each gave the attendant out sizes, and she was able to find the right shoes for each of us on one of the many shelves of shoes. We went back to our lane and sat down to put our shoes on. We then each selected a bowling ball that was the right weight for us. I programmed the computer for our lane so that each of our names showed on the screen above us. We each rolled our balls down the lane, taking two turns at a time. None of us did very well, but we still had fun knocking down pins and catching up. At the end of the games, we returned our shoes and left the bowling alley.I live in very small town, and do not have many things to do. One of the sport is bowling. We decided to go for it this weekend. I looked online if they have any deals for group, and i found one. I booked online. We do not have any bowling shoes, so it was extra, but that is OK. I made my kids ready and they wore comfortable attire. The time was from 4 to 8 pm. we got ready about 3:30 pm. we already bought tickets, we did not had to worry about that.Then , we packed some snacks and drinks, if by chance we need them. Then we went to bowling, and reached there 10  minutes earlier. Went exchanges shoes, and got our spot for our group. At first, only 2 sticks were down, but by the second round I made all sticks down on first shot.Will wanted to go bowling with his friend Allen, but he didn't have enough money to cover the cost for both him and Allen so he just went alone. Will brought his own ball and when he stepping in the door he could smell that fresh bowling smell. so Will went up to the counter and asked the woman operating the shoe station for a size ten pair of shoes. He laced up his shoes and was ready to go. he saw an open court and he took it. he pressed the new game button and off he went. he saw that the pins were set up in a very specific way but he was ready for that challenge. he rolled the ball so far onto the lane that it knocked out all of the bowling pins and he received a strike! everyone was so amazed. Will did amazing. he kept bowling until the night ended.  he got so tired that he eventually had to call it a night and go home. Will returned the bowling shoes and laced up his old regular ones again taking those shops off was like taking power away from him. Will got back in his car and drove back home.My friends and I decide to go bowling this Friday. We decide to call ahead to the bowling alley nearby to reserve our lane at 8 PM on Friday. At Friday 8 PM, we all meet up at the bowling alley and we check in with the worker. He charges us an admission and shoe rental fee. After changing into our new shoes, we head to our lane. The first round took us about 40 minutes to complete. After getting the hang of everything, we complete the second round in only 20 minutes. Everything took us about an hour to complete. At about 9 PM, we decide to leave so we return our shoes and proceed to leave. After saying our goodbye's we go our separate ways. On the way home, I decide that I had a good time bowling so I remind myself to schedule another event very soon.I drove the the bowling alley closest to my house. I walked in the door and went to the counter. I told the cashier how many games I would like to play. He asked if I would like to rent bowling shoes. I said yes. The cashier asked my shoe size and I told him I wore a size 9. The cashier went to the back and got the right size shoes. The cashier told me my total and I paid the bill. After I paid, the cashier told me what lane I would be using.  I then went and picked out a bowling ball. I picked a hot pink bowling ball. I then went to the lane that was assigned to me. I put in my name on the computer and began my game. I played 4 games. I then started to get hungry so I went to the snack stand and ordered nachos. After I ate my nachos, I played two more games. I then returned my bowling ball to the proper place, and returned my shoes to the cashier.  The cashier told me to have a nice day and to return soon. I walked out the door and got in my car. I enjoyed spending the afternoon at the bowling alley.One day my mother took me out to a bowling alley to spend time with my family and it was a new experience for me since I usually never go out and get socially active with people, But once I was out there long enough and started to loosen up and have fun with my family it was a very fun experience and we all laughed and joked around. We had a team battle where all the girls took on the boys at one point my team being the boys were down and we needed a major comeback and eventually what happened was I was able to bring the boys back into the game. Finally the game came down to one last move, If I got a strike we would win and if I didn't we would lose and surprisingly I was able to get the strike and get my team the win! I had so much fun and I would like to go back one day.My friends and I wanted to go bowling. We got in the car and headed to the bowling alley. When we got there, we rented some bowling shoes. The worker sprayed the shoes to make them clean. We put on the shoes and went to our lane. We selected a ball based on the weight since some can be really heavy. Then we took turns throwing the balls and trying to knock the white pins over. Everyone tried to get a strike. Sometimes we missed the pins and the ball would roll into the gutter. Then we got hungry and had some chicken wings from the bowling alley's diner. The glow in the dark round came on and all the lights turned off and everything was glowing. Then, we returned the shoes. Then the music came on and it seemed like a party. Finally, we got sleepy and went home.When I was a teenager, I asked a girl if she would like to go bowling with me at a bowling alley.  She said that she would come and asked me what to bring.  I told her she didn't need to bring anything but herself.  I picked her up the next day and we drove to the bowling alley.  We got out of the car and went into the bowling alley.  We bought a couple of games to play and had to rent shoes so that we wouldn't slip on the slippery floor.  We got a couple of decent weighted balls to throw down the alley.  We took turns throwing the ball down the hall and trying to hit the pins on the other side.  She was a lot better than me and scored more points.  After about 18 throws, the game was over and we put our balls away and went to leave.One day I went bowling.  Oh what fun bowling was! I threw a 300 round I think. I think that makes me up there with some of the best guys of all time. I guess I will have to come bowl more often. I also like the styles of the bowling alley. The shoes they give you are so nice. I like the old feel and look of them. It is weird thought that so many other people have put their feet into these shoes before. It is alright the shoes are fine. There are also a lot of other shoes to choose from in the store there. You can pick white ones or red ones, and you can even buy new balls there too. Just ask for the service department. Anyway, after I bowled my big round my family took me out to dinner to celebrate. I have nothing but good memories of bowling.Last night I went bowling with some girlfriends. We met at the bowling alley and traded in our sandals for some black and white bowling shoes. We laced up the shoes and set up our scorecard with each of our names displayed on the screen. Then one of my friends went to get us all sodas and snacks, and when she got back we started the game. The first game we played just to warm up, so we didn't keep score on the screen. We just took a few turns to get into the groove. Then we got serious and began tracking the score. I won the first game, but then my luck ran out. My friend Sarah won the next two games. Jill did not win any games, but she was a wonderful friend and kept our snacks and drinks filled. Mary Beth was the scorekeeper, though she didn't win either! When the game was over, we traded back for our shoes and drove home.I was bored and wanted to play a game. This time I decided I would go bowling. I drove to a bowling alley and payed the worker there to rent some bowling shoes. I put the shoes on to make sure they fit, and was told which lane would be mine to bowl in. I went to my lane with my bowling ball, which was just the right size and not too heavy. I stepped up to the line on the floor and swung the ball under my right shoulder onto the floor. The ball hit the floor and rolled quickly down the center of the lane. A lot of pins were lined up at the end of the lane, and my ball rolled right through the center of them. All the pins fell down and I scored a strike. I was very impressed, and a machine picked the pins back up for me and put them back at the end of the lane. I threw my ball a few more times until the game was over.My friend Mary and I went bowling last night.  First we looked up bowling alleys online to see which places were closest.  We picked one that was close to my house.  When we got to the bowling alley it was pretty crowded and we had to wait in line to get a lane.  We bought two games and rented some shoes.  Mary and I entered our names in the computer at the bowling lane so that we could keep score. We both got to pick out balls from a rack.  After we did that, we started bowling.  Mary was able to knock down all the pins a few times so she got strikes.  I usually knocked down just a few at a time.  When the game reached a score of three hundred, Mary won. In between the first game and the second game we bought some food from the counter.  We played one more game and then decided to go home. Mary and I returned our shoes and drove home.My wife and I were looking for something to do last night.  We agreed on bowling.  We got in the car and drove to the bowling alley.  We went to the front desk.  The people at the front desk were very nice.  They asked us how many games we wanted to bowl. I wasn't sure, and I looked at my wife.  We decided we would bowl two games.  They asked us what size shoe that we wore.  I told her that I wore a size 11.  The lady got me a size 11 shoe and told us to go to lane 2.  My wife also wanted a drink, so we went to the concession stand.  We bought a soda and went to lane 2.  We both put on our shoes, and then we searched through the balls to find ones we liked.  Once we found our shoes, we began bowling.  I went first, and my wife went after.  We exchanged turns throwing the ball, and we kept each others score.On Saturday night, I decided to go bowling with four of my good friends.  When we got to the bowling alley, we paid the cashier.  Then we each got shoes to go bowling in and selected our bowling balls.  We had to try a few balls by picking them up to see how it felt when we held it.  After everyone had their shoes and their balls, we went to our assigned lane.  Once there, we had to set up the computer that keeps track of the scores by putting in our names.  When that was done, my friend Darren went first. He got a strike!  After Darren, Lori, Ann, and Jeff went.  I went last and got a gutter ball.  I got to go again and I knocked over five pins.  The computer calculated our scores and we went onto the next frame.  At the end, the computer tallied everyone's final scores.In the town I used to live in, there usually wasn't much to do as far as activities go. However, when the local bowling alley opened up, that instantly became a popular spot to hang out. It had just about everything from arcade games to bowling to a bar, and they served great food. A usual visit to the bowling alley involved me and either a group of friends or family. We would start things off with an actual game of bowling. We would go over to the counter to check in and get our bowling shoes, followed by getting our lane. While one person set up the game of bowling, the rest of us would go and get the right sized bowling ball that we wanted. When everything was all set, we'd proceed with our game. I usually always came in last, since I'm not very good at bowling. After the game of bowling, we'd go off ad play arcade games and laser tag.My friends called me on the phone to ask if I was interested in going bowling with them. I've never experienced what it's like to do so and I wanted to change that, so I agreed to go bowling with them. They went online to book a reservation for our group of five people. We traveled to the place by car and we arrived 10 minutes early. I was so surprised once I saw the setup we had. Everything was glow in the dark. They call it cosmic bowling. We all put on our bowling shoes and then we had to agree on which bowling ball we would use. I was shown how to put my fingers in the holes of the bowling ball. Then I stood behind the foul line which is a piece of colored tape or painted line, aimed for the pin at the front of 10 pins, and rolled the ball down the lane. I knocked 7 pins down on my first try. I had such a great time and told my friends to never come without me,Friday night my friend Stacey called me and invited me to go bowling with her and her friends.  I was excited and met them at the bowling alley about ten minutes from my home.  When I got there I rented bowling shoes in my size and put them on over my socks than met with my friends.  I bowled a few times not hitting any of the pins down.  Than to my amazement I aimed for the center and made a strike!  All the pins fell down.  I was very excited.  How could I recreate this again I wondered?  Throughout the evening I kept aiming for the center and made a few more strikes.  Bowling takes a lot of practice but above all it is fun.  It was nice playing with my friends and we made a great evening out of it.  Next time I think I will bring other people with me!Yesterday I went bowling with my friends.  They told me that they would meet me at the bowling alley at 3pm.  At 2pm I started getting ready.  By 2:30pm I was ready.  I made sure to bring socks with me, since you will need socks once you get to the bowling alley.  I grabbed my car keys and got in my car.  I drove to the bowling alley.  I listened to a little bit of music on my way.  Once I got to the bowling alley, I parked my car and then walked inside.  Once I was inside, I walked over to my friends.  I asked them how many games they wanted to bowl. They told me that they wanted to play two games.  I walked over to the cashier, I asked how much each game would cost.  The cashier said that each game would cost $3.50.  I wanted two play two games with my friends so I paid $7.00.  Next, I needed to buy shoes so that I could bowl.  I needed special shoes to go bowling so that I wouldn't slip on the floor when I went to bowl.  I asked the cashier for a pair of shoes, size eight and paid four dollars for a pair.  Now I needed a bowling ball.  But I didn't want a bowling ball that would be too heavy.  So I chose one that was only five pounds.  All of my friends came over to our lane where we were bowling.  We all put in our names so that each of us were playing on the same game.  I was first.  Before I started I made sure to put on my bowling shoes, and leave my old shoes by where we were sitting.  Then I took my bowling ball, put my fingers in each hole, aimed, swung my arm back then I let go of the bowl.  The bowling ball flew down the lane.  Out of the ten pins I knocked down six.  Since I didn't knock down all of the pens, I got to go one more time, before it was my friend Sarah's turn to bowl.  I bowled again! This time I knocked down four pins.  Since I knocked down all of the pins I got a spare! By the end of the game I had won the most points out of all of my friends! I won! I returned my bowling shoes and then we all left to go eat dinner!After dinner and bath it was time for bedtime. I made sure my kids brushed their teeth and got into their pajamas. After I tucked them snugly into their beds I sat at the edge and picked out their favorite book so we could read a few pages together. We always pass the book back and forth so we all read together. I make sure to help them if they have trouble with the words, so that we can all learn from our mistakes. We usually read a chapter in our bedtime book, but then it is time to close their eyes and drift off to sleep. I make  sure to kiss their heads before I cut off the light and pull the covers up so they stay warm. I always leave the door cracked so they have a little light in case they need to use the bathroom or come get me if they're scared.Last night, I watched a movie at home with my daughter. At 8pm when the movie was over, I turned the TV off because it was time to get ready for bed. First we went into the bathroom. I started running the bath while my daughter undressed. I put bubble bath in the water and helped my daughter step into the bathtub. After about 10 minutes, it was time for her to get out of the tub. I gave her a towel to dry off with and helped her get into her pajamas. After she brushed her teeth, we went to the bedroom. I tucked my daughter into the bed so that she was nice and warm and comfortable under the blankets. I sang a lullaby to her and then turned off the lights, leaving only a nightlight on. I said "sweet dreams," and quietly stepped out of the room so she could fall asleep peacefully.When I checked the clock, I saw it was getting late. It was time to go to bed. I took my child into the bathroom, and helped him get washed up to go to bed. I made sure he brushed his teeth, washed his face, and washed his hands until he was clean. I made sure he used the toilet, so he wouldn't have to get up during the night. Then, we went to the bedroom to get ready. I helped him out of his day clothes and got him into his pajamas. I helped him get into bed and tucked him in. Then, I read him a bedtime story. We always like reading bedtime stories together, and I always make sure he reads parts himself. Once the story was over, I tucked him in and turned out the light. It wouldn't be long before my son drifted off into sleep.Taking my child to bed at night is one of my most special parts of my day every single day. Our bedtime routine is generally the same every day. It begins with a bath. My child loves a bath and will absolutely not go to bed unless he can have his bath. He swims and plays in the bath tub long after he is squeaky clean. Next, he gets into pajamas and brushes his teeth. After that, he comes and holds my hand and tells me he is ready for his books. We both walk hand in hand to my bed, where he sleeps. He picks some books and climbs up into bed. We pull down the covers and both get cozy. I read him two, three or four books until he feels settled and tired enough. Then, I turn out the light and lay next to him as he says his prayers. He then tells me his favorite part of the day. I give him a kiss on the head, I blow a bunch of kisses from the doorway and say "One Million Kisses in the Room". I then leave and he goes to sleep.It was almost my daughters bed time, so I began to get her ready for bed. After her bathe, her hair being brushed, as well as her teeth she was ready to put on her pajamas. Once she had put on her pajamas, I walked her to her bedroom. I made sure to leave her night lite one. She wanted me to read her a story before bed, so I did. She listened to the story as I read from the book, helping me turn the page. It was not past her bed time so I told her she needed to go to sleep. I tucked her into her bed and made sure she was not going to fall out and on to the floor, maybe hurting her self. Once she was tucked in, I brought her a glass of water just in case she got thirsty in the middle of the night. I shut the door and let her sleep.It was about 8PM and my daughter knew it was her bedtime. I reminded her that it was time to get ready for bed, and to do what she needed to get done beforehand. She went into the bathroom, put the stool out in front of the bathroom sink, and washed her face. After she finished that, I reminded her to brush her teeth. I brushed my teeth alongside with her. I then helped her to floss her teeth. She then ran into her bedroom knowing she was finished getting ready. She untucked the covers and got into bed. I turned on her nightlight and read her a quick bedtime story she picked out from her books on the bookshelf. As I got ready to leave the room, I kissed her goodnight and said I would see her in the morning. I flicked the light switch as I left the room.It was family movie night so my husband, myself and our three kids sat on the big comfy purple couch and watched the newest Pixar film, while eating popcorn. Once the movie was over, our two youngest had already been asleep so we each carried one child to their respective beds. We didn't bother to wake them up to brush their teeth ( I feel guilty whenever this happens. ) we covered them up made sure night lights were on and kissed them goodnight. Our son was still up so we took the opportunity to snuggle a bit longer before taking him to brush his teeth. After teeth were brushed we made sure the night light was on and that he was all set for the night. Hugged him real tight gave him a kiss and said goodnight. Five minutes pass. "I need a drink." Five more minutes pass. "I need to go pee" Five more minutes pass. "will you rub my neck and hair until I fall asleep?My little daughter was really tired last night.  She had fallen asleep while her mom was feeding her and she was starting to sleep.  I didn't want to wake her up, so I made sure to take her from her mom's arms without making any noise.  She startled a little bit but went back to bed.  After I had her in my arms, I walked slowly to her room that was dark.  I walked up to her crib and made sure that there was nothing in there that she could grab.  With one gentle swoop, I place her down in her crib.  She stretched a little bit, but kept her eyes clothes.  I slowly backed away from her room and made sure not to trip on anything.  As I backed up, I shut the door behind me so that no light would get into my daughter's room as she slept.It was getting late and the child had to go to bed because the child had school the next day.  The child needs to get some rest.  First, I took the child to the bathroom, so that the child could brush its teeth and use the toilet.  The child brushes its teeth and uses the bathroom.  After that I took the child to its bedroom so that it could change into its pajamas, so that it could sleep comfortably. The child changed and was ready to sleep.  After that I put the child in the bed and started to read a bedtime story to help the child sleep. I read a story for a little, and the child was getting really sleepy. Then the child wanted some water, so I went to the kitchen and got a cup of water for the child.  In a little while, the child had gone to sleep.After a very long Saturday morning, my younger daughter of five and I were relaxing, watching television, when I noticed she started to doze off a bit. I asked if she was ready to lie down and go to bed. She had no issue at all saying yes, and I was a little tired myself, for it was a long week. I extended my hand for her to grab and help up out of the couch and walked her to bed. We made small talk, letting each other know we had a great day together, and looking forward to the next. My daughter jumped right in bed immediately after brushing her teeth and using the restroom one final time for the evening. I opened up the covers for her, fluffed up her pillows, and she lied down. I gave her a kiss, tucked her in, we both said goodnight with a loving smile, and I exited the room, leaving her to her sweet dreams.When I last took a young child to bed, I remember it being a difficult experience. I put my little cousin to bed and she is two. This was really tough because she was hyper and did not want to go to sleep. I had to follow a whole structured routine to get her to go to sleep so that she would sleep. This was somewhat difficult, but I first walked upstairs with her and picked out a book, then went to her room and read the book together. When I noticed her start to get tired, I slowly started to stop reading and I left the room. I used the monitor to watch her and noticed that shortly after, she fell asleep. This was not overly difficult, but I had to follow the whole routine to get her to go to sleep. Eventually she fell asleep for the night.Every night I must put my son to bed. His name is Alex, and we have the same routine we do each and every night. Last night, we started our bedtime routine by taking a bath. Alex played with his bath toys, and splashed around in the bubbles. He then got dried off and put on his pajamas. Last night he wore his favorite pajamas with Lightning McQueen from the movie "Cars". We went into the bathroom and brushed our teeth, Alex used his green Crayola crayon toothbrush, and got his teeth nice and clean. We then read a bedtime story, last night was Goodnight Fish, which was a book he got when he and his grandparents went to visit the aquarium. After that, he got tucked into his crib, with his favorite blanket, and his favorite stuffed animals: a lamb and a penguin. We sang "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star", and turned off the lights. Like each night, it was a good night.I hear moving feet and the cry of a child. Long days I work, steady and always getting into something at work. I come home after my hours, papers left on the ground, TV turned on and an iPod laying on the couch. "Daddy, daddy", the young one shouted, bed times in few minutes, "papa papa", I wanna stay up late!, no time, school in the morning, young life, needs training, only way to earn this is going to sleep early. I get him to brush his teeth, being hard on the one will make me look at him when he gets older. He lays in his bed and I read him a story, it's a goosebump story, night of the living dummy. He loves haunted things at such an early age, I did too, that's how father and son get along. I finish and head out the room and I say goodnight to you son, and so too you too dad.I was babysitting for my younger sister once and it was almost time for her to go to sleep. I gave her a bath, helped her brush her teeth, and put her pajamas on her. She was only two so she needed a lot of help. After she was all ready to go to bed, we sat in a chair together to read a couple of bedtime stories. When we were halfway through the the second story, I looked over and noticed that her eyes were starting to close. I shut the book and put it on the bookshelf, and slowly picked my sister up. I brought her over to her bed and laid her down on top of her pillow. I tucked the blankets up over her head, made sure she had her pacifier, and shut all of the lights except her nightlight off as I left and shut the door.Every night, I'll take my son Jimmy to bed. First I take him to the bathroom so that he can brush his teeth and wash his face. Then, I take his hand and lead him to bed, he usually is yawning by the time we get there. I make sure he's in his pajamas and then under the covers. I usually read him a story that I let him pick out. The other night he picked out "Where the Wild Things Are" which is also his favorite book. After the story, I'll kiss him goodnight and turn off the light, but usually Jimmy will ask me to turn his nightlight on, but not always as sometimes Jimmy likes to look out his window, but only when the moon is bright and the sky is not cloudy. I will tell him "good night," one last time before I close his door and go to bed myself.It is late at night and the sun has gone down, and my kid is sleepy. It is bed time. He is still very little though and needs some help going to bed. I take him to his room and make sure he gets ready before going to sleep. He brushes his teeth and washes his face so he stays clean and healthy every day. Once he is done, he changes into clothes for sleeping so that his other clothes stay clean while he sleeps. He crawls into bed and I pull the covers over him. His head rests on his pillow so he is comfortable and can fall asleep better. He is afraid of the dark like me, so I leave a nightlight on for him in the hallway. A little light at night can help you feel better and more relaxed, but too much light keeps you awake. I tuck him in and say goodnight and let him fall asleep.Emily had fallen asleep on the sofa after supper while we were all watching the new movie Dad had rented. The movie had been boring, and Emily had fallen quickly asleep. Mom asked me to try to wake her when the movie was over, but she just snored louder every time I tried to shake her awake. She was such a deep sleeper. Dad sometimes joked that she could sleep through a brass band marching through her room. I believed it now. I had tried very hard to wake her up. I went in and told my mom I couldn't get her up. Mom smiled and hugged me, told me good night, and patted my head. I went into the living room to watch as she kissed Emily on the forehead. She gently slid her arms under Emily's sleeping body, and lifted her up to chest level. I followed her up the stairs and to the room me and Emily shared. Mom pulled the covers down on Emily's bed, and I pulled mine down. Emily woke up just enough to climb down from Mom and snuggle under the covers. Mom kissed us both once more and turned out the light.It was night time and it was time to go to bed.  The boy wanted to keep playing.  I told him that after he got ready for bed I would read a story to him.  He dawdled a bit but finally started getting ready for bed.  First of all he had to take a bath.  He splashed in the tub and spilt water all over the floor.  Next he dried off in a big, fluffy blue towel.  Then he brushed his teeth with his special Star Wars toothbrush.  Next he dressed in his Star Wars underwear and then put on his Star Wars pajamas.  His dad and I tucked him into his bed that was made with Star Wars sheets.  He said his prayers.  Next was story time.  I pulled out his favorite book about (you guessed it) Star Wars.  He gradually dozed off dreaming about Anakin Skywalker and a galaxy far, far away.Yesterday I decided I needed to get to the grocery bus . My car had a flat tire , so I decided to ride the public bus . First , I went online to see the map of the public bus ' because it overwhelms me and I am afraid I will get lost . Then I called the bus hotline and asked the operator how to get where I wanted to go . He helped me figure out what buses I need to take where . Then , I had some lunch , took my backpack and left the house . I had to walk to the bus stop . On the way , I could smell the exhaust from the cars and I already started freaking out . The exhaust is really unhealthy for you . Then I waited for the bus at the stop . After 20 minutes , the bus I needed finally came . The bus came to stop , the doors opened . I stepped onto the bus and gave the driver my money .Today , I had to ride the bus home from the market . I walked over to the bus stop to wait for the next bus . It was supposed to arrive in 10 minutes . When the bus pulled up to the bus stop where I was waiting , I stood up and walked over to curb . The bus driver opened the bus doors and I stepped up into the bus . I had to hand my money to the bus driver so that I could ride . Once the driver took my money , I walked down the aisle to find a seat . There were many seats available so I picked one beside an older lady that looked like my grandmother . She was very nice and talked to me while we rode down the street . Once the bus stopped down the street from my house , I got off and walked down the sidewalk to my house . I was very glad to be home .I was walking to my car last night from work and was ready to drive home . I started the car up , but I noticed that I left my phone at work , so I turned the ignition back off , locked the car doors , and shut the driver door . Unfortunately for me , I shut the door WITH my keys still in the ignition . That 's right ; I was locked out of my own car . Flustered and embarrassed , I pulled at the handles of the doors and attempted to open the trunk off the car - no luck at all . I walked back to my office , got my phone , and contemplated what I would do next . There was no one there with me , so my only hope was riding the public bus -LRB- I did n't have money for a cab -RRB- . I waited for the bus , the last one of the night , at the bus stop . The bus driver opened the door for me and I came aboard . I paid the two dollar bus fare so that I could ride and asked him for a transfer so that I could get on the next bus at the terminal . I took my seat , and the bus took me to the terminal at the plaza . I got off the bus and hopped on the bus that would take me home . I handed the transfer to the driver and took my seat . As I approached my apartment , I pushed the button to request for the bus to stop . The driver pulled over , and I thanked them and got off . When I got in the apartment , I immediately jumped into my bed . I was dead-tired , and though I had the dilemma of having my keys locked in the car , I would figure that out in the morning .I walked to the bus stop near my home so that I could get to work . I brought along my purse which had my bus card in it so that I could ride without paying cash . It only took a few minutes for the noisy bus to arrive . It stopped at the bus stop and the door opened . The bus driver scanned my bus card and I walked to an empty bench near the middle of the bus . Many other passengers boarded the bus after me and soon the bus was nearly full . Looking around me , I saw a number of senior citizens as well as other young adults . There was even a woman with a sleeping baby sitting on the bus near my bench . I decided to listen to music on my smart phone while I waited for the bus to reach my destination . The bus stopped every few minutes to let other passengers on and off of the bus . After about an hour , the bus stopped at my bus stop and I got up and walked out of the bus , wishing the driver a good day .I woke up early in the morning and walked from my house to the road where the bus travels . This is a busy bus route , so there are a lot of buses I can catch at this spot . I waited 10 minutes and saw a bus in the distance coming my way . I waited patiently at the bus stop making sure the bus driver could see I wanted to board . The bus driver stopped the bus and opened the door for me . I had to wait for some other passengers to get off the bus first . I walked up steps into the bus and paid for my trip . There is a machine that collects money and tokens in front of the bus . Luckily , there was a seat available to sit in . I rode the bus for about 10 minutes until we were coming close to my stop . I pulled the string to tell the bus driver I wanted off . I said goodbye and got off the bus and went to my destination .I usually do n't take the bus to work but today I decided to give it a try since the bus stop is right across the street from my house . When the bus came I greeted the bus driver with a friendly hello and paid my bus fare . I was lucky enough to find a seat all the way in the back . There was a lot of different people on the bus , some were kids going to school others were adults going to work like I was . I watched the bus come to a stop every few blocks and drop off a few people , but for every person that left a new person got on . I noticed my stop was near so I pushed the strip on the wall that notifies the bus driver my stop is coming up . When he pulled into the next stop I exited the back of the bus and was happy that after 15 minutes I finally reached my destination .I took a public bus to get the work this morning . At around 8 am , I left my apartment and walked to the nearest bus stop which was about a 10 minute walk from home . Once I got there , I waited for the bus to arrive along with two other people . After about 15 minutes , an express bus heading to Manhattan arrived . I boarded the bus and paid the driver my fare . I then walked to a window seat near the front of the bus , that was free . It was pretty early , and the bus was initially somewhat empty . However , several stops later , the bus was filled with fellow commuters heading to work . Along the way , the bus passed through about 5 different towns while traveling on local roads , before headed out to the George Washington Bridge to get to Manhattan . While getting there , the bus ran into a traffic jam which caused a 20 minute delay . After working its way through traffic , the bus made it onto the bridge , and several minutes later , we were at the bus terminal on 178th Street . Once we got there , the bus stopped and the driver let us out , whereby I then walked to the office .I ride the bus to school everyday . I live in New York City so riding the bus is a common thing . Everyone does it because it is convenient . In our city , it is very packed , so driving is n't as convenient or affordable . Parking is expensive so public transportation saves us a lot of money . Every morning when I go to school , I wait by the bus stop . The morning bus comes every ten minutes . Once it arrives I board onto the bus and I insert my metro card . The metro card has a balance of money stored inside it . This money is subtracted from the balance every time I ride the bus and insert my metro card . Basically the metro card pays for the bus ride . When I run out of money , I go to a metro card machine and put more money into my balance . Riding the bus is annoying sometimes . In the morning , it is very crowded so sometimes there are n't enough seats for everybody . This means I have to stand while holding on to a pole . Sometimes its so crowded that I am sandwiched in between people . If I am lucky , sometimes there will be open seats . Otherwise , I have to stand for 40 minutes .Yesterday my car broke down , so I was thinking of how I would get to work . I decided one of the best options would be to take a public bus . Since I 've never taken one before , I went to the city website and looked at a schedule of all the bus times and routes . When I had finally decided on the bus that I needed to take , it was time to put my plan into action . I left my house and walked over to the bus stop . There were a few other people waiting there as well . When the bus arrived I got on and paid the driver the fee , which was $ 1 . I then sat down and waited for the bus to arrive at my destination . It took about 40 minutes to get where I was going , and I arrived safely . I think that overall it was a pleasant experience .I needed to get from my house to work , but my car wouldn ' t start . I decided my best option was to take the bus . I walked down the street to the nearest bus stop that would take me close to work . I waited for about five minutes for the bus to come . Once I got on , I put my money in the machine and headed towards the back to find a seat . There were only three open seats so I took one of them and popped in my ear buds to listen to music . I also brought a book along to read so nobody would try to talk to me . The bus made three stops before we got to the corner nearest to my work . Each time people would get off and as they shuffled past would bump into my knees which was really annoying . Then more people would get on and some would find seats , but others had to stand . One person stood directly in front of me , in constant contact with my legs . This really annoyed me even more . I don ' t like riding public transportation . Finally we got to my stop and I got out of the bus through the rear doors .I needed to get to the craft store , there was a sale ! Unfortunately , husband had the car and he would be gone a while . I decided to take the bus . I made sure I had a couple dollars for the fare and walked to the bus stop . I waited about ten minutes , then the bus came around the corner and stopped at the bench I was sitting . A few people got off the bus and I stepped through the doors onto the bus . I smiled at the bus driver and put the money into the machine to pay for my ride . I took a seat at an open place and looked out the window . The store I was going to was only a few stops away and when I saw we were close , I pulled the cord to signal to the driver I was ready to get off . He stopped at the shopping center and I thanked him for the ride as I stepped onto the pavement .I have never had to ride a public bus until 4 years ago when I had no other transportation and was forced to take a public bus anywhere I needed to go . The first thing I had to do was find a bus schedule and learn how to read the time and places to catch the bus and how to make any needed transfers . This was a little hard to do but once I figured it out it was OK as long as I always kept a schedule with me . I mostly took the bus to work and I only had to worry about catching one bus on the street I lived on and I did not have to sorry about any transfers . The bus ride cost me $ 1.25 and transfers where an additional 50 cents . Many people rode the bus and I meet several nice people on the bus . The bus drivers were always nice and I became friends with several of them . The bus only came once an hour and I had to make sure I did not miss it if I was going to work because then I would be late for work . The bus always made a stop at the main depot in order to pick up more people . There was usually about a 20 minute wait so the driver could have break in the late afternoon . I did not like having to take the bus but it served my purpose for a while and I was thankful to have the bus available .Last week , my friend and I rode the public bus into town . We looked at a bus schedule and found the bus stop closest to our homes . We got to the bus stop ten minutes before our bus was supposed to arrive and waited . When it arrived , we got into the line to board . Each person in front of us climbed the steps and put a token into the machine at the front of the bus . We had no token , so we gave the bus driver our money and he gave us tokens to put in . We found a seat at the back of the bus and sat down . We checked our bus schedule and decided where we wanted to get off . When the sign at the front of the bus showed that it was our stop , we gathered our things and prepared to get off . After we got off , we made a note of which bus stop we were at and the time the bus would be there again to take us home . Then we went off to explore the town .Yesterday I had to go across town to the library to return some books . All my friends were busy and my car was in for repairs , so I had to take the bus . First thing was to see what bus I needed . I went over to my computer and pulled up the bus schedules for my city . I found the nearest bus stop and checked the bus lines that stopped there , then looked for the stop nearest the library . There was a bus that went to both stops , so I would n't have to change buses to get there . Next I found the next time the bus would be at the stop near my house , which was only 15 minutes from now . I grabbed the books and headed out to walk to the bus stop . I got to the stop about 5 minutes early and waited for the bus to arrive . It was only 2 minutes late , which is n't too bad . I climbed into the bus , paid the driver and found an empty seat . It was a pretty nice day , so I just sat there looking out the window until we got to the stop by the library . I got off the bus and went inside to return my books . It was a good bus ride , no problems with traffic at all .'' `` Riding A Public Bus '' '' Hannah and her mommy had just moved to the city . Daddy took the car to work each day now and her and mommy decided they wanted to go to the shopping center . Hannah was excited because today was her first time taking the public bus . Hannah and her family had moved to Portland , Maine and the bus they were taking was called the Metro . Hannah took her mom 's hand as they walked down the sunny streets of the city until they reached a sign that Hannah could not read but she did understand the picture . It was a picture of a bus . '' `` Does that sign say bus mommy ? '' '' Hannah asked . Her mother replied that it was and it was one of many many places around the city to get the bus to stop for them and others . They waited for a long while and finally a large public bus came down the street and stopped before them . They waited while a few passengers exited the bus because her mom said it was the polite thing to do and then they climbed the steps where her mother dropped their coins into the busses toll collector . Her mother then asked for a transfer and they walked quickly to their seats . Hannah asked her mom what a transfer was and she explained that because they were going way across the city they would need to get on yet another bus and the transfer was so the other bus driver could see they already paid for their ride . Soon the bus jolted to another stop an older lady stepped onto the bus and flashed a card at the bus driver and took a seat at the front of the bus that was saved for elderly and handicapped people . Hannah tugged at her moms sleeve and whispered the lady did not pay . Her mother quietly told her she had a bus pass that she paid for a whole months worth of rides for a bigger fee than just one ride . That people who use the bus daily buy them to save money . Hannah thought to herself she would like bus passes for her and mommy . She enjoyed the bumpy ride with the jolting stops and wide turns that made her have to hold on tight . Hannah also noticed people pulling a cord and she figured out why . It made the bus driver stop where ever they would like to get off . Oh how she wanted to pull the string but , mommy told her no . It was only for when you needed it . Soon the bus stopped at the busy bus station . They stepped off the bus and got on a new bus . Her mom handed the bus driver their transfers . Hannah was excited because this meant the next place they were going was the shopping center to buy her new shoes . Soon the bus took off and made stop after stop . They even picked up a man in a wheelchair . He drove his wheelchair right up a special ramp and into a spot on the bus where the driver buckled him and his wheelchair in . Soon Hannah 's mom told her she could pull the cord to make the bus stop . The cord was up high but with a little help from her mom she reached it . Ding ! The bus came to a stop shortly after and there was the shopping center right in front of them . Taking the bus was a fun form of transportation . Hannah waved to the driver as he pulled away to pick up and drop off even more people around the city .Every time I have to go to school or work I have to always ride a public bus . I have to make sure that I am by the bus stop in order to catch the bus on time . When I get on the bus , I have to pay the bus fare . I live in a big city , so there 's always a lot of people needing to take the bus . Therefore ; sometimes I am not lucky to find a seat to sit on . In that case , I would have to stand up . Overall , riding a bus is not enjoyable because it tends to be dirty , people are very loud , and it is very crowded . Not to mention , it always smells like urine . My commute is always a long one . I usually stay on the bus for one hour . For that one hour on the bus , I listen to music or play on my cell phone . Eventually , I get to my stop . I get off the bus and reach my destination .Last Saturday , I decided to visit a friend in the hospital . I own a car , but it 's been acting up lately , so I needed to take the bus . I set out from my apartment with a spring in my step , because it was an amazing day . I walked through my apartment complex 's parking lot to reach the bus stop , where I waited for the bus around 5 minutes . When it came to a stop in front of me , I boarded and put a $ 1 bill and 2 quarters in the fare machine . I selected a seat near the entrance , because it has more space and fewer people . Riding the bus often gives me motion sickness , so I closed my eyes and tried to ignore the swaying motion as it rolled down the street . Behind me , two college students were eagerly discussing a class project . In the very back , a small child was loudly pretending to be a dinosaur . I was glad when I finally reached my destination . I pulled the cord signaling that I would need the bus to stop next to the hospital , and got up to exit out the bus 's side door . Fresh air never smelled so good !I live near the city of Santa Cruz and often take the 17X bus to the nearby city of San Jose . It 's possible to get discount fares by paying for multiple rides in advance , but I usually pay cash , five dollars for one-way . I get to my small town 's transit center early on weekday mornings , because the bus fills up quickly , and most good seats are already taken by riders who started their trip in downtown Santa Cruz . We wait in line in civilized fashion . Some people need only show the driver their pass , some shove a five-dollar bill into the fare machine efficiently . But some fumble with small coins or ask other riders for change , which makes everyone in line restive . Once on , riders can choose seats grouped around small tables , seats facing forward , or seats facing sideways . Table seats are premium , since the bus has WiFi and many people bring laptops . Others prefer seats in the back where the roughnecks are , just like in high school . My little town is the last stop before highway 17 . The bus whips along amid the pine trees and the yellow-flowered acacia that blooms this time of year . It is pleasant not to have to keep your eyes on the road . Unspoken bus etiquette decrees that strangers do n't speak to each other , but of course some people know each other and chat . Many tap away on their machines or play video games , others read books or enjoy the ride . It ends at San Jose 's train station , where passengers can transfer to the San Francisco train , or take a rattling inferior 1-hour bus ride to Fremont to catch the BART mass transit line to Oakland , Richmond , or distant Pittsburg , where the California Delta begins .My car was in the shop , so today I decided to commute to school on a public bus . First , I looked up what bus I would need . I found I need to take two buses and transfer in the middle . I started walking to the first bus stop and arrived ten minutes before the bus was scheduled to arrive . It came on time , and the bus driver let off the other passengers . I stepped onto the bus and paid the driver the fare . Then I found an open seat by a window and sat down . The ride was around 15 minutes or so . Then the driver announced my stop . I headed out the back doors . Outside , I found a bench and sat down . The next bus came fairly quickly . I hopped on and showed the driver my transfer ticket . This time , the bus was packed , so I found a pole and hung on . The ride was n't too long , however , and soon I was at my final destination . I found my way off the bus and walked over to school .Last Friday , my car broke down . I had to get to work Monday , so I decided to ride the public bus since it ran fairly close to my home and work both . Monday morning I got ready early and set off to wait at the bus stop . After sitting for quite a while , the bus finally pulled up . I let others at the stop get on first , then I got on . I asked the bus driver how much the fare was and he told me . I paid the fare by sticking my money in the box near the bus driver , and walked to find a free seat . I found one near the back of the bus , and I sat down . The bus ride was fairly quick and uneventful . I noted that the ride went the same route that I did . Once the bus stopped at the stop near my work , I disembarked . That 's how I rode the public bus .This past weekend, my family made so much food that there was still plenty of it going into the week. Knowing this, we chose not to make any new food, because we could still eat the leftover food from the weekend. All we would need to do was warm it up on the stove top. The stove is a gas stove, which produces a flame that, in my opinion, cooks food much better than an electric stove. On Monday after getting home from work, rather than making a new meal, my mom took some of the food that we had saved from the weekend and put it into a pan, and put that pan on the stove. She turned the gas on until the burner ignited, and left the heat on until she felt that the food was warm enough. When she ate it, she swore it was as good as it was when it was freshly made.The other day , I finished reading the fourth book of the Game of Thrones Series . With the new season about to start on HBO , I wanted to get ahead of the show and continue reading the books in the series -- but I did not want to pay for the next book . Remembering that I had a library card somewhere in my desk at home , I went home and found it . I went to the library and after browsing the fiction section , I finally found the fifth book in the series and brought it to the check out desk of the library . I handed over my information and library card and checked out the book , getting two weeks to read it for free . I 'm now a quarter of the way through the book and enjoy every page of it while loving the fact that my taxes paid for me to read this and I had to pay no extra money .One evening, I noticed my alarm clock had stopped working, because I had just checked the clock in the living room, and my alarm clock showed a different time. I knew I had to change the batteries. This is important as I need it to wake me up in time for work. I grabbed the clock, turned it upside down and located the slot for the batteries. I lifted the plastic cover and checked what batteries it required: two AA-sized batteries. These are quite common, and I got them from the kitchen drawer. I removed the old batteries by lifting them up, then I placed the new batteries in the same position, making sure the plus-side of the batteries (the little tip) were in the right direction, as it is usually engraved on the plastic. I closed the lid carefully, and the clock started ticking again. I adjusted the time with the help of my watch, and went to bed, knowing I would be woken up by my alarm at the right time the next morning.I was nervous about a date coming up with a friend later in the week. I wondered what could help me relax and feel better. I thought that a nice trip to the sauna would be good. The thought of the warm steam making me feel cozy seemed good. I drove myself to the closest sauna and payed to go inside. I went into a room first to change clothes. I didn't want any of the clothes I was wearing to get wet and steamy, so I brought a swimsuit to change into. The steam works best when it touches your skin, so you want to wear a swimsuit or a towel. I moved into the sauna room and sat on a bench in the warm steam. It was very relaxing to be in there, like a hot bath. After a while, I left and changed back into my regular clothes. I felt much better and was not as nervous after visiting the sauna.I was excited to go to the museum and learn more about history. I waited in line with the other people wanting to go in, and when it was my turn I paid for my ticket and then went inside. There was so much to see! There was a room about different kinds of rocks and where they came from. Another part of the museum had skeletons from all different kinds of old animals--dinosaurs, a sabretooth tiger, and even a mammoth! The plaques next to them told me all about when and where the animals lived. While I was at the museum, I moved from one room to the next and took my time to read as much as I could so I could really enjoy the trip. I spent all day learning about natural history, and there were still things I didn't get to see so I planned to return to the museum as soon as I could. It was a wonderful day!Time to make breakfast! I'll get the coffee started because it will be the perfect temperature by the time all the food is done. I grind the beans and put filtered water into the electric kettle and get it started. I need to put a filter in the Chemex and pour in my ground coffee beans. Meanwhile, I'll gather my ingredients from the fridge. I want eggs, butter, English Muffins, and Canadian bacon. A breakfast sandwich sounds good. I'll get the English muffins toasted in the toaster. My water just finished boiling, so it's time to pour that in the Chemex over the ground beans. I need to get the frying pan and put a little butter in there and turn on the pan. I grab and egg and scramble with a fork. My pan is heating and the butter is melting I put my egg in and swirl it to cover the bottom of the pan. While I wait for my eggs to set up, I'm going to microwave my Canadian bacon. Back to the eggs, they are almost set so I'll fold them into a half circle and flip. Grab my toasted English muffins on a plate. Layer my Canadian bacon and fold my freshly cooked eggs on top. I'll pour myself a cup of coffee and now I can sit down for breakfast. Looks good.Before you plant a tree , you must contact the utility company . They will come to your property and mark out utility lines . Without doing this , you may dig down and hit a line , which can be lethal ! Once you know where to dig , select what type of tree you want . Take things into consideration such as how much sun it gets , what zone you are in , and how quickly you want it to grow . Dig a hole large enough for the tree and roots . Place the tree in the hole and then fill the hole back up with dirt . Many small trees will need support until they are bigger . This will ensure they grow tall and straight . It is crucial to keep the tree watered ! It will need a lot of water at first . Mulch is helpful to keep the soil moist . It 's also important to wait until the threat of a frost has passed or is not in the near future . Giving care to your new tree will ensure that it will grow big and strong !I was at camp and getting ready to lead a workshop teaching cooking on a campfire. Luckily it had not rained for a few days so all the wood in the area was dry. I had some large logs that were sitting by the fire ring so I went searching for some smaller sticks and kindling. I built a log cabin structure out of the larger logs. Inside the log cabin structure I put some very small tinder as well as some balled up pieces of newspaper. I lit the newspaper and continued adding very small pieces of wood to it. When the small pieces started catching I started adding larger twigs. As smaller pieces started catching on fire I kept added larger and larger twigs and sticks until the big logs started burning. I continued to add sticks so I could get a nice sized fire burning that would create lots of hot coals so we could cook on them.First I go to the store and buy bread.  For the freshest bread, I get a whole loaf and bring it home to slice it there.  I use a bread knife which makes cutting it easier, and cut off just what I need for the toast, leaving the rest whole.  I wrap and store the remaining loaf for next time.  Then I get the toaster out of the cabinet and place it on the counter, then plug it in. I choose the darkness of the bread - not too dark, somewhere in the middle for flavor and safety - then indicate the slice thickness using the knob on the toaster. I place the first two slices of bread in the slots and press down on the big button, which causes the bread to drop in and the toaster to get very hot. The timer counts down and I pay attention to it carefully, making sure the toast pops up and the toaster turns off.  I unplug it immediately but let it cool down before putting it away as it is very hot.  I butter the bread using a knife and then put away the knives and butter.I like to ride on trains because you can see lots of countryside without having to worry about driving . One time , when I lived in Alaska , I rode on a train from Fairbanks to Denali park . Just like with all train rides , I had to buy a ticket first and then I had to stand in line to wait for the train to stop at the station . Then I climbed onto the train and picked a seat . The different places you can sit in a train are called cars . You do n't have assigned seats like on a plane and the seats are wide for more than one person to sit . So , I picked one in a car in the back and sat right beside the window . After the train started moving , a train attendant walked through to check our tickets and then I stood up to walk around . You can walk from car to car on a train and can even go out of the back of the very last car and stand outside , so I did that . It was very fun to be standing outside while the train was moving and I hung onto the railing to be sure I was safe . Then I went back inside and went to the dining car where I bought a sandwich and water . After I got back to my seat , I ate and watched the scenery through the window . I saw lots of interesting things including a moose and we arrived at Denali right after that .I showed up at the airport a few hours before my plane was scheduled to take off. I had all of my bags packed and my identification ready. I found my airline and made sure that I was in the right terminal. I checked my bags and kept my carry on bag with me. I printed off my boarding pass and went through security. I put all of my metal objects in a basket to leave with the security agent. I took off my jacket and went through a metal detector. Then, I got all the items back from the TSA agent. I checked my boarding pass to see what gate I needed to be at to get on my place. I went to my gate, so I would be waiting in the right place. Since I had extra time, I got a coffee from one of the vending areas and read a magazine until it was time to get on my plane.I miss my best friend Shelly and so I decided to send her a letter telling her all about my trip to my sister‚Äôs house in Alaska, and to also tell her that I hoped she was well. I finished writing my letter and as I went to find a stamp and an envelope I needed to send it, I had found that I did not have any. I went to a store that sells cards and envelopes, and chose a box of pretty purple-colored envelopes to mail my letter in.  After that I went to the post office to purchase some stamps that are like small stickers, and chose a heart design that I liked. I only needed one to send the letter but I bought more so that I could send another letter soon if I wanted to. When I got home I filled out the envelope with Shelly‚Äôs name and address in the middle, and wrote my sister‚Äôs address in the top left corner of the envelope. I stuck the stamp with the heart design on it in the upper right corner. Now it was ready to be put in the mail and she will receive it in about one week. I drove to the post office and put my letter in the outgoing mail slot. Shelly will be so surprised!I needed to visit my Grandma upstate , so I decided to take a train . I purchased my tickets online and printed out a receipt . I packed a bag . The next day , I headed over to the train station and checked in at the ticket counter . I was early , so I picked a spot on a bench and sat down . After a short while , everybody lined up to get on the train . A train worker checked all of our tickets . I entered the train and picked out a seat for myself . Then I loaded my bag overhead . Once everyone was on the train , our conductor announced that we were leaving the station . Another train worker came around and took everyone 's tickets from them . I spent the ride looking at scenery out the window and reading mostly . Eventually , the train conductor announced my stop . I retrieved my bag from the overhead compartment , and headed downstairs and off of the train .One afternoon when I was visiting with friends, we suddenly got very hungry!  So, we decided to order a pizza.  I looked in the telephone book and found several pizza restaurants that would deliver.  We all talked it over and settled on a pizza from Domino's.  Then we discussed what we would like on our pizza and what size we should get.  I called the number and gave our order to the person who answered.  We ordered a large pepperoni and onion pizza with extra cheese.  He told me that our pizza would cost $15.00.  I said that would be fine and asked if the pizza could be delivered.  He said, "yes" and asked for my address.  I then gave him my name, address, and phone number.  He told me that our pizza would be delivered in 30 minutes.  When the delivery boy arrived, we paid for our pizza and included a $2.00 tip.  Then we enjoyed eating our pizza!The previous night and this morning before work I noticed I was missing a lot of necessary ingredients for my future meals . I planned out a trip to the grocery store immediately after work . After I finished working I drove over to the store . It was very crowded but not too hard to find a parking spot . Once inside the store , I grabbed the nearest shopping cart and smiled as one of the grocery workers welcomed me in . Once inside and out of everyone 's way , I thought about what I needed . Since I did n't have a list written down , it took me a few minutes . Once I came up with the list in my head , I started to map out a route in my head that would take the least amount of time for me to follow in the store . First , I picked up my deli . They offered me some free samples of the meat I asked for . Then I picked up my bread which was right nearby . At the back wall of the store I found the meat I was going to cook tonight . After that , I grabbed a few extra items that I thought might also be nice later this week while heading towards checkout . Luckily , there was n't a line and this was done quickly . I paid with my debit card and left with all my groceries in a cart , packed them into my car , and headed home .My family and I decided that the evening was beautiful so we wanted to have a bonfire.  First, my husband went to our shed and gathered some dry wood.  I placed camp chairs around our fire pit.  Then my husband placed the dry wood in a pyramid shape inside the fire pit.  He then set some small kindling ablaze using a long lighter.  Once the kindling reached the dry wood, it set the wood on fire.  We then sat around the fire for some time, adding more logs as the previous ones burned out.  We cooked marshmallows on sticks over the open flames.  When the marshmallows were golden brown, we placed them between two graham crackers with chocolate pieces.  We ate our S'mores as we joked, laughed and told stories around our beautiful fire.  When we finished, I put away our camp chairs.  My husband made sure the fire was out by dousing it with some water and we went inside to bed.I like to stay in touch with my family and friends.  Usually when we are busy we stay in touch by texting but we like to hear each others voices so we often call each other.  My friends and brother like to use our cell phones.  I give them all a special ring tone so I know who it is right away when they call.  I take my phone out of my pocket and look at the face and see my brother or friends picture.  Then I swipe the green phone icon and hold it to my ear and say "Hi There."  But sometimes I still use land lines, like when I am at work or my grandparents house.  Then I will hear the classic ring of an old phone, and I will have to go over to the phone to pick it up.  I take the receiver off the cradle its sitting on and hold it to my ear and say "Hello."  The person on the other end will have to introduce themselves, because I wont know who has called.  But usually I am lucky and its someone I want to talk to, so its a fun surprise.Last night after dinner, I had "dishwasher duty." That means that it was my turn to do the dishes and unload the dishwasher. After the dishwasher had washed the dishes, I first opened the door to the dishwasher. I unloaded the bottom rack first. That way, if any water drips or leftover food were stuck on the dishes still, they wouldn't trickle down to my clean dishes. The bottom drawer usually has my plates in it. After unloading the bottom drawer, I unloaded the top drawer, which usually contains my cups, utensils, and my bowls. I use a towel to dry off any leftover water drips. I then put all of the dishes back into the original cupboard places that they came from. That means that I put my plates in the cupboard near my sink, and I put my cups in the cupboard near my fridge. Lastly, I put my utensils and bowls in a cupboard near the microwave.I needed to clean up my flat. I had to get my broom and vacuum and all the cleaners I would need. I started by going around and picking up any garbage I seem, like used candy wrappers and old bottles of water.I threw them away. I went around and picked up and dishes that were out and put them in the sink then washed them. I used my broom to sweep up all the dust and dirt off the floors the hard floors, and the vacuum to clean up the floors that had rugs and carpets. When the hard floors were swept, I used a bucket with floor cleaner and water, and a mop, to mop them up. As the dried I took a rag and began dusting everything in the room. The t.v., the tables and counters and everything else that was a hard surface, I used the rag to dust. My flat looked very nice when it was clean.I wanted to have a nice dinner with my friends and family, so I cooked all of our favorite foods and invited everyone over. I decided to go ahead and set the dining table before everyone arrived. I put the place mats in front of each chair at the table. I then placed dinner plates on each of the place mats. I folded my favorite napkins neatly and placed on beside each plate. I also made sure that everyone had a fork, knife and spoon. The last thing I put at each place were the glasses. I gave every person one glass for water and another glass for any other drink they might want. I had tea, soda and milk for the children. Before I placed all this on the table, I made sure to put my favorite red tablecloth on the table. Everyone sat to eat and we had a delicious dinner together.Heather and her mom always do laundry on Thursday nights.  Every Thursday, they start with gathering all the dirty clothes from the hampers in each bedroom, and bathroom. Then, they put them into a larger basket and bring them to the laundry room.  They sort the clothes carefully into three main piles : colors, whites, and darks.  Sometimes there is a fourth pile, it is for delicates.    After they sort these clothes, they put in the first pile of clothes along with detergent, into the washer and turn the washing machine on.  They pick the water temperature they want, and let it wash those clothes.  After the first load is done, they put it into the drier. They start another wash load as the first one is drying.  They keep doing this until all the clothes piles are washed and dried.  They fold all the clothes, and put them in the rooms they came from for the other kids to put them away.I have a cat and his name is Felix. He needs to get some food every day so that he stays alive. When I wake up in the morning it is my turn to feed Felix. I go to the cupboard below the sink and find the tin of his cat food. It is a fishy one. Felix likes fishy food. I get the can opener and twist it so that the lid of the tin comes off. Inside there is a brown and jelly mixture that doesn't smell too good to me. Felix has already smelled it and he is purring at my leg. I find Felix's bowl and turn the tin over until the food drops out into the bowl. I mash it up a little with a fork and then put the bowl down beside Felix. He starts to eat right away. He must have been hungry. I also give him a little bit of water because he needs to drink also.Yesterday, I went on a date with my husband. We decided to go on a picnic in the park. Before the date, I got out our picnic basket so I could fill it with some good food. In the picnic basket, I put in some leftover cold fried chicken. I also put in a potato salad, some grapes and strawberries. For drinks, I put in some sparkling water. Then I add made sure to include napkins, utensils, and a picnic blanket. The park is close by to our home, so we decided to walk there. It took less than 5 minutes to arrive. When we got there, my husband laid out the picnic blanket on the soft grass. We sat down, and I emptied the basket. We had a good time. We were talking and laughing while eating our food. We some birds and gave them some of the breading off the fried chicken. The birds loved it. It was fun, and we really enjoyed each other's company. It was a good break for us from everyday life. Afterwards, we packed our stuff and took a stroll around the park. It was beautiful sunny day. Then we headed home. At home, we said to each other that we should on dates more often.My wife invited some friends over yesterday to watch one of their favorite foods.  Because we were going to have guests over, we wanted to make sure the bathroom was clean in case they needed to use it.  To clean the bathroom, we got out the cleaning supplies from the closet.  We got out glass cleaner, toilet bowl cleaner, paper towels, and a scrubber.  We took turns washing the mirrors in the bathroom, organizing the counter, and then cleaning the toilet.  I was the one assigned to do that, of course.  I made sure that there wasn't any dirt or gross things on the toilet.  I poured the toilet bowl cleaner into the bowl and scrubbed it all over the toilet.  After I did that, I got the paper towels and made sure that I cleaned up all the wet stuff that was left over on the toilet and the seat.The Barker family was going on a family holiday trip next year and they were preparing for the event. The Barker family started saving up some money in a jar, and it started to accumulate. the higher the pile in the jar got, the more money they had to spend on their trip. Soon the family was ready to go! the season came around so quickly and they were already packing to leave town for the week. the Barkers ventured out into new and uncharted territory for them. They went to a place called: California. California was warm compared to where they lived in Alaska. they were so overjoyed to feel the heat on their faces. They took so many pictures and sent uncountable postcards. they got to their hotel and went to sleep, they had such a long plane ride. In the morning they traveled to Disney land and had so much fun! they went on rides and went to different parks. but they had already spent a week in California. so it was time to go home the Barkers booked a plane and got the plea tickets they packed up their luggage and checked out of the hotel. they got on the plane and traveled home. They got to Alaska and went home when they got to their door they all went to bed immediately.After an extremely hard week at work, I decided that I wanted to treat myself to something nice. For this something nice, I decided to go to a sauna. I had never been to a sauna before but I had heard a lot of my friends talk about how much they loved it and how relaxing it was for them, so I figured I would give it a try. I got to the sauna and was greeted by a very calm and soothing employee who first directed me to a massage room. I waited and got a great massage which made me very relaxed and ready to go into the sauna. I entered the sauna and the first thing I noticed was that it smelled very woody, almost like being deep in a forest. It was also very hot inside but it wasn't unpleasant. I sat down in the corner and closed my eyes, trying to relax. I spent about thirty minutes in the sauna enjoying the heat and took a shower when I was finally ready to leave. Going to the sauna was the perfect relaxation I needed after my stressful week!I had been having issues with heartburn.  It's like everytime I had a meal, I was in pain and in agony.  Finally, I decided it was time to see the doctor.  I called the receptionist at the office to make an appointment.  She asked me what my problems were and booked me down for the next week.   I came in early for my appointment.  They had me update my health insurance card and fill out some paper work.  Then it was a short wait before the nurse called my name.  She brought me to the back and got my weight and other information.  We talked a bit and she led me into the exam room.  It wasn't long before the doctor came in.  He checked me out and talked to me about my condition.  He gave me a prescription, but also told me to stay away from foods that made me hurt.Last night, my friends and I wanted to make a bonfire. So, we made sure that we had some fire wood. We went to the back of her yard and gathered up some dry wood. My friend reminded us that the wood had to be dry, or else it would not burn very well. Next, we all helped out by placing the chunks of wood into the fire pit. Once we stacked the wood into the fire pit, my friend grabbed a lighter and lighter fluid. My friend poured some of the lighter fluid out onto the wood, and then used the lighter to light the wood. It took a few tries, but the wood finally caught on fire, and we were able to start our bonfire. As the fire continued to burn, we added more wood or newspaper to keep the fire burning. We all had a fun time sitting around the fire and talking.Yesterday I made a flight reservation to fly from Boston to Chicago.  The first step in making a flight reservation is to determine which airline you would like to fly.  I picked American Airlines because I have most of my airline miles with them and I always like to earn more miles.  I accessed the American Airlines website and entered the desired dates of my flight.  The website then provided me a bunch of different flight options for both my departing and returning flights.  I selected the flights that worked the best for me and were the most affordable and I selected them.  I was then directed to pay for my flight which I did via my American Airlines credit card.  Once my flight was paid for I received an email confirming my transaction and providing me my flight details.  I find that using the internet is much easier than calling the airlines for a flight reservation.We spent a week getting our gear together for our big camping trip. After making sure everything was packed and the tent had no holes from the last trip, we put everything into the car and set out on our way. After a four hour drive we arrived at the campgrounds. We found our spot and unpacked the car. First up was pitching the tent, then we set about making a fire to cook dinner. It took awhile to collect all the wood we needed and get it roaring, but once we got the food on the fire we could finally relax. After soaking in nature and enjoying our campfire meal, night had fallen and it was time for bed. We curled up in our sleeping bags and told scary stories until we drifted off. The next morning we awoke early to stoke the fire and get breakfast started. A day of hiking and fishing went by far too fast and after another night under the stars we packed up our gear and headed home.It was a very hot sunny Saturday morning and me and my family decide to go to the beach. Before going to the beach we had to pack the car. We packed some snacks. We packed a cooler with all our drinks and water. We put on our bathing suits and brought towels, beach chairs, a beach umbrella, beach toys, and a beach ball. Mom brought sun tan lotion to protect us from the sun. Once we got to the beach mom and dad setup all off the chairs, umbrella and towels. Mom laid down on a towel while dad went running to the ocean. We swam but not too far because the water was very deep. There were a lot of waves and some people there were surfing with surfboards. There was other people that were playing volleyball on the beach and there were a lot of kids building sand castles. Dad helped us build our sand castle with a pool so that when the waves came in it would fill in our pool. At the beach there was also a tower for the lifeguards to see everyone in the water. There was a guy who went out too far into the water that the lifeguard had to blow his whistle for the guy to come closer to the beach. I have heard that sometimes you can see shark in the ocean but lucky for us we did not see any sharks. Visiting the beach was very fun for the whole family as mom can relax and get a tan and dad could play and swim with us.Yesterday I hosted a barbecue for about twenty people. It was a really fun event and I enjoyed having my friends over to my beach house.  To prepare for the barbecue I went shopping at the grocery store for hamburgers, hotdogs, rolls, chips, salad and soda.  When I returned from the store I prepared the salads and laid all of the food out to be cooked on the grill.  As my friends began to arrive one of them volunteered to cook all of the food while the rest of us socialized and played volley ball.  As the food was prepared we all enjoyed eating a burger or hot dog and then we quickly returned to playing different lawn games such as croquet and horseshoes.  After a few hours my friends decided that it was time to go home.  We really had a fun afternoon and I am excited to host a few more barbecues this summer.I need to buy a new dress, so I am going to the shopping centre. There are many stores there, so I am likely to find a nice dress. It is for a celebration I will attend. I drive to the center. It is three miles away and traffic is good. When I arrive, I easily find a parking space near the entrance. I walk to the entrance. The shopping center is very large and modern looking. It was only built two years ago. It has three levels. I enter the centre and begin strolling through the main level. It is not very crowded today. There are escalators that you can take to reach other levels. There are many large windows, so it is almost like being outdoors. I can smell coffee and cinnamon buns from one vendor. A few birds are inside, and they fly around. There are pots with trees planted in them. From where I am standing, I can see exactly which stores I want to go into. I am confident that I can find the dress I want.In the morning I felt hungry and decided to make myself some scrambled eggs for breakfast. I took out a carton of eggs from the refrigerator and placed it on the counter. From the carton, I took three eggs and inspected them for cracks. They looked fine, so I cracked them into a small bowl being careful to to have any shells in it. I added a splash of water and then began to scramble the eggs with a whisk. Next I heated up a frying pan with a little butter in it. Once the pan was hot, I poured my eggs in it. After adding a dash of salt and pepper, I kept scrambling the eggs. Occasionally i would remove the pan from heat while scrambling for a short moment. Once the eggs looks firm and ready, I turned off the stove and plated my eggs to enjoy. I added a small sprig of parsley to the plate to make it look even fancier.Yesterday your father and I decided to go play a few rounds of tennis.  Tennis is an outdoor sport game played usually with two people, sometimes there are two people on each team called pairs.  There is a low net between both people playing the game.  We use tennis rackets and tennis balls to hit the ball back and forth to each other.  Sometimes one person can hit the ball out of bounds of the other person and that makes them miss the ball so that person scores.  The person with the highest score without any fouls or out of bounds wins the set.  We played for a few hours before both of us became extremely tired, then we came home.  It was really a good workout for the both of us and we would like to take you to watch and play the next time we decide to play tennis.After the week was over, my wife and I sat down to make a shopping list.  We thought about foods we wanted to eat that week.  I looked up some things on the internet that we could try, that we had never tried before.  We found some good recipes and made note of what food that they needed.  We wrote down the food and the amount that we would have to buy to make the recipes.  We circled all of the food on the list that we thought we might not need to buy.  We took the shopping list and also wrote down where in the store we would find the food.  We organized it from the fruit to the dairy in an organized order.  We put the shopping list on our fridge so that we wouldn't forget it the next day when we went to go buy the food.Sometimes for dinner I like to have fish instead of chicken or beef.  When I want to have fish for dinner I will go to my local fish market and pick out something I like.  Some times it might be salmon, sometimes tuna, or maybe a white fish like tilapia or flounder.  I will buy a pound of it, and the fish monger will wrap it in wax paper and put it in a bag for me.  Once I have it home, I check it, finding it clean and not smelling at all like fish.  I will put it in a glass casserole dish and season it with salt, pepper, garlic, lemon, vinegar and olive oil.  I might put a few onions in with it.  I will turn on the oven and while the oven gets hot I will make a salad.  Once the oven is hot I will put the fish inside and set a timer.  While the fish bakes, I will make other side dishes.  When the timer rings I know its done and I carefully take it out with oven mitts.  It smells so good of garlic and its nice and cooked through.  While I set the table, I let it cool and after a few minutes I serve my self a piece and my salad and side dishes.When I was younger, my mom wanted to make sure I would be safe around water.  She took me to the swimming pool to get better at it.  One day, we went to the swimming pool and brought our towels.  We got in the car and drove a few minutes to get there.  Sometimes, I would get bored when my siblings would swim, so I brought the book The Lord of the Rings with me to read if I was bored.  We made it to the pool and they stamped our hands when we arrived.  I went to sit down by the grass hill until it was my turn for a lesson.  While I sat there, I read a book. Then it was my turn to get in, so I put my book down and got into the water.  The teacher taught me and then I got out of the pool.It was afternoon and I was not sure what I was going to fix for dinner. I asked my little boy and he requested ham and cheese croissants. It is one of his favorite meals to eat and also to help prepare. He asked if he could help with preparing dinner. First, we got an oven pan and lined it with Aluminum foil. We opened a can of croissants and unrolled them. He cut each pastry triangle in half, so that each would be small and we could have more. He placed a slice of ham on the croissant piece and sprinkled it with shredded cheddar cheese. We began rolling up each piece from the long side, all the way until there was a croissant piece, ham and cheese rolled up. We placed them on the baking sheet and put them in the oven. In 15 minutes, they were golden brown and baked with love from my baby!The other day, my friend wanted to go outside.  I suggested that we go and play tennis.  He said that he had some racquets that we could play with, so I told him to bring them.  I drove to the tennis court that was at the park and we got ready to play.  I brought some balls to hit and he gave me a racquet to play with.  We started on opposite sides of the court and practiced hitting the balls over the net.  We did a really good job and decided to start playing.  We kept score by whoever made two bounces on the opposite team's court.  I did really well and I won over 40 points.  That meant that I had one the game.  But there were many games in a set, so we kept playing until I came out as the winner in the end of it all.I decided that for Mother's Day I wanted to make a camping trip, so I called the camping grounds to reserve a space. Once I confirmed that our space was reserved for our trip, I began to pack our belongings in art suitcases. I packed pillows, bed sheets, pillows, food, medicine, toiletries, shoes, and anything else that I felt we needed to have with us while we were away. Additionally, I ensure that we had bug  repellent spray, hats and jackets to protect ourselves while out in the wild. We also brought pots, pans, gallons of water, eating utensils and even an electric griddle so that we could cook and eat- even if we did not have a stove or oven. Once everything was packed, the luggage was all packed into the back of the truck, I also had to gather the camping tent, foldable chairs and sleeping bags for our trip, and load them into the truck as well. The last thing I needed to pack was some canned and nonperishable foods that could be cooked, along with things such as bread, snacks, soda and juice. Now that we have covered everything from sleeping arrangements, clothing and food, and it was all packed in the truck and ready to go, the only thing left to do now was get in the truck and drive off on our way to our reservation.I recently attended the wedding of two friends of mine from college.  It was a long drive away, so my date and I drove there in regular street clothes.  We changed into our formal wedding wear once we arrived at the hotel where we would be staying for the evening.  We drove to the church and walked in.  The wedding was about to start so we quickly found some seats near other friends of ours.  An organ began to play, which let us know that the ceremony was starting.  Members of the wedding party arrived in a procession.  The bride was the last to arrive at the altar.  A minister performed the ceremony.  The bride and groom exchanged vows and also exchanged rings.  When the ceremony finished, the couple kissed, and everyone applauded.  Then the bride and groom and their bridesmaids and groomsmen marched back out of the church.  Afterwards, they took many pictures before the reception.It was a cool spring evening and we wanted to have a family get together on the beach around a bonfire. After getting permission from the city, we began to plan the night. First we went to a local man and bought all of the necessary bonfire wood, which is much bigger than the logs that would go into a fireplace. We went to the grocery store to pick up all of the necessary ingredients for a cookout next to the bonfire. We bought burgers, hot dogs, and buns for each. We made sure we had every vegetable available to go onto a burger including condiments and cheeses. We picked up several bags of chips and ingredients for s'mores. We arrived at the beach just before sunset and built the bonfire with the very long logs. Once we felt like they were all in place, we lit the fire and began to cook so everything would be ready for our guests once they arrived.I wanted to watch a movie and decided to rent one form a store video rental. I drove to the store and entered the building. It was set up in sections according to movie genres; drama, comedy, horror, action, animated, thriller. I decided to head to the drama section. I looked through there available titles. I picked out a recent release and brought the empty box up to the counter. There the attendant took the film cover and went to find the corresponding film. They brought back the film in a clear cover and told me I had three days for the rental. I paid for it next. Then I went home and watched the film. It was enjoyable and I was pleased with my selection.The next day I returned it to the store. I did not want to forget to return it because there are late fees for late movie returns.We were excited about the awesome new mall and planned all week to visit it this past weekend! I called my sisters and friends and we all decided to meet in the front at noon on Saturday. There was plenty of parking and nice security cameras to keep us safe. We walked in the first large store and everyone decided to split up and meet at the food court two hours later. Alone, I looked at the ladies shoes. I bought a pair of dress up shoes and walked over to the nearby makeup. They were having a promotion so I bought my favorite kind to get a free bag and then checked out a new kind before I bought some and lipstick. Both were priced great. Next, I went to the housewares section and bought a coffee maker in black. Hand mixers were on sale across the isle so I bought one for the camp. The color I chose is red to match the blender. Next, I left the large store and went to nearby children's store to pick out toys for my kids. Four games and two balls looked great and exactly what they would like. Then I spotted some outdoor clothing and searched for something to give me to a little relief from daily laundry. After I went to a wonderful new ladies purse store and bought a new Gucci for the job interview ahead, I realized it was time to meet at the food court. Realizing it was all the way across the mall, I hurriedly walked that way and saw my friends and sisters standing in front waiting. We shared some strawberry ice cream and coffee before we walked back to our cars and said goodbye. As I drove home and thought about my purchases and good time with friends and family, I smiled. I live in a nice city.Yesterday I woke up and decided to wear my favorite cardigan sweater to work.  After taking a shower and eaten breakfast I started getting dressed.  I put on a pair of jeans and then I reached for my favorite black cardigan.  As I began to button it up I realized that one of the buttons had fallen off.  Of course I did not want to wear any other sweater, just this one as it was my favorite.  I went to my spare room and dug my sewing kit out of the dresser.  I found a thread and button that would match and I quickly threaded a needle.  I began to methodically move the needle through the holes in the button to sew it back onto the sweater.  After a few minutes I cut the thread and secured the button to the sweater.  Finally I was able to put my sweater on and head off to work.My wife and I flew on an airplane a couple of months ago . We were going to Las Vegas because a friend of mine was getting married . He lives there and said that he would pick us up from the airport . But , the weather here was cold and there was freezing rain , so our flight was delayed for two hours . It was kind of scary taking off because the weather was still cold and rainy , but after two hours of sitting there waiting , I was ready to go . People on the flight were pretty happy to finally leave and a lot of people were having drinks . Everyone was getting ready for their own little party in Las Vegas . The flight itself took a little over four hours due to the fact that we had a non-stop flight . I was glad I paid the extra money for not making any stops . Six hours sitting on an airplane is more than enough for me . The flight was pretty uneventful except for the lively passengers , so that was a good thing , especially since my wife hates to fly . My friend ended up still picking us up from the airport and we had a great time in Las Vegas .I wanted to spruce up my house before my team members from work came over for a training. I had three paintings of plumeria flowers waiting to be hung on the wall. These paintings were very special to me. A friend gave them to me. They use to hang in her house that she recently sold. I was happy to receive them and hang them in my house. I first decided which wall would best display the pictures. I picked the wall in the dining room. I put the paintings on the floor at the base of the wall to see how I would space the paintings. I then asked my daughter to hold one painting up so I could measure the distance from the ceiling with a measuring tape. I measure the distance and marked the wall with a pencil. I hammered a nail on the mark and then hung my pictures.Today I went to the sauna and relaxed in the room for thirty minutes. I went with a friend and when we opened the door to the sauna, we realized that it was cold. I adjusted the temperature, on the outside of the sauna, and we waited inside of the sauna room while the coals of the heater warmed the room up. The room took about five minutes to reach the comfortable temperature that I set it at and we sat in the room for half an hour. As we relaxed in the room we had a conversation and when we felt as if we had spent enough time in the sauna we dried ourselves off with the towels that we brought with us to the room. After we dried off, we left the room and I turned off the thermostat, of the sauna, so that it could cool back down.We normally set a menu on Sunday for each day of the upcoming week to avoid chaos during dinner time. Before I leave for the day in the morning, I am sure to put out the ingredients I need for the dinner ahead of time and defrost any meat I may need to prepare the meal. At around five-thirty, I begin preparing the meal. One meal I prepare often is ground turkey meatloaf and seasoned green beans. I mix the ground turkey with some bread crumbs, ketchup, and a bit of egg to bind it. I also lightly season it for flavor. I push it into the loaf pan, and put it in the oven to cook. I then begin preparing the seasoned green beans. I like to use fresh green beans. They may involve the extra work of snapping off the ends before cooking them, but they taste so much fresher. I season them with red pepper flakes and a little bit of lemon juice. When the oven dings, dinner is ready for my family and I to enjoy.I was reading a great book in my favorite chair when suddenly the light went out. I flicked the switch on my reading lamp, but it did me no good. It looked like that light bulb had burned out. I went to the hall closet and poked around, and luckily I found just what I needed, a package of light bulbs just like the one that had burned out. I brought one of the new bulbs back to the living room, and unscrewed the old used-up light bulb. I put it on the kitchen counter so I would see it in the morning and remember to recycle it at our city's transfer station. Then I screwed the new light bulb into the light socket  and turned on the lamp. The light shone bright and clear. I settled back into my chair with a sigh, and opened my book again.My hair is dirty and feels oily when I touch it today, so it is time to wash it. I like washing my hair in the shower because it is much easier than in a bath tub. I turn the shower on and make sure the water is nice and warm, but not too hot. I step in the shower and get my hair nice and wet. It is good to use shampoo and conditioner. First, I take some shampoo that I like and rub it onto my head. This cleans the part of the hair that is close to your head and also cleans the skin there that gets oily. After the shampoo is rubbed into my head, I let the water from the shower rinse out all the soap. Once the soap is out, I take some conditioner and rub it into the longer parts of my hair and the ends. This keeps it nice and soft and healthy. I let the conditioner sit in my hair for a while, and then rinse it all out in the warm water. I dry off, and feel better knowing that my hair is nice and clean again.This morning, like any other morning, I woke up still tired. Coffee is something I require daily to function. Up until last year, I used a regular coffee pot, and would brew about six cups, and drink most of it. Last year, for my birthday, I got a Keurig machine that brews individual cups. It has become a hobby of mine to collect different coffee and tea flavors, and try something new. Today, I felt like having one of my fancier kinds of coffee. This kind is a Gevalia mocha latte. It tastes like a hot chocolate and coffee blended together. I added some water to my Keurig machine, and within a minute it was ready to brew. I put the k-cup into the slot on the machine, and added the chocolate packet to an empty coffee mug. Today I used my favorite teal coffee cup with birds and flowers on it. The machine sputtered out a delicious cup of coffee, I stirred the chocolate powder into the coffee until it was blended. I grabbed a chair at my kitchen table, drank my delicious high-calorie breakfast, and was ready to take on the day.In my English class I was recently assigned to read the book brave new world . My first idea was to just buy it but when I went to the local bookstore it cost $ 20 . $ 20 for a book is more than I am willing to pay so I decided to go to the local library . Calling in ahead to make sure that they did indeed have the book that I wanted , I then headed in the direction of the library . When I arrive they had already had the book up front as I requested so that all I had to do was go pick it up . Or so I thought . In actuality I had to spend time getting a new library card . The librarian walked me through the process while also giving me a little background on the book I was about to read . After I had gotten my new library card I simply gave it to the librarian and she checked out the book for me . Now it is time to dig in to this novelI recently graduated from college and decided to throw a party at my house to celebrate. I wanted to invite my classmates who graduated along with me. I made a list of everyone that I wanted to invite. Then, I went to the store to buy the invitations. I looked through the rows of cards until I found the graduation invitation section, with one section specifically for college graduation. I looked through the selection of cards there until I found a few that I liked. Deciding that I wanted to send a variety of different cards to my friends, I bought a few of each card until I had enough cards for everyone. Then, I went to the cashier, purchased the cards, and went home. Once I got home, I wrote messages in each of the cards along with the names of each person that I was inviting. Then, I mailed the cards.For my anniversary with my husband, I decided to cook him a very fancy and nice breakfast. One thing I had always wanted to do but never got to try was making fresh squeezed orange juice. I figured that our anniversary would be the perfect time to try this! I went to my local farmer's market and got the biggest, juiciest oranges I could find. I got about ten oranges because I wasn't sure how much I was going to need to make enough juice for both me and my husband. I got home and pulled my juicer out from underneath my sink. It was still in the box since it was a wedding gift I had never had a chance to use! I was excited to try it. I sliced all of my oranges in half and plugged the juicer in. I began using the juicer to squeeze the juice out of my orange juice. To my luck, I only needed about five oranges to make enough juice for me and my husband so I saved the rest of the oranges for later. I brought my husband his breakfast with the orange juice, and he said that the juice was his favorite part!I went for a driving lesson when I was sixteen years old. In my town, the driving lesson had to be 3 separate days of driving for two hours at a time. My driver was very cool and relaxed. Driving for the first time is a very nervous experience so it was good to have such a laid back guy as my instructor. It helped to put all of the worries to rest. I was very nervous at first. But we started driving around town and I got more used to it. In the instructor's car, they have pedals on their side of the car as well. So that is a comfort knowing that they can take control of the car if anything goes wrong. That really helped to make me worry a lot less. Overall, it was a very good experience and I felt very comfortable by the end of it.It was a Monday evening in a warm July heat wave. My wife and I had just completed a particularly tasty meal that I had prepared for the both of us. We were both very full and sat in momentary silence as we pondered the situation in front of us. We knew we had to clean the table off, but neither of us were particularly excited about the task at hand. At last, we came to a conclusion. I would clear the plates, silverware, napkins and drink glasses from the table and put them in the dishwasher. My wife would grab some wood-cleaner from underneath the cabinet so we could wipe down the table-top. After the plates, silverware, napkins and glasses were clear, she sprayed the wood cleaner across the surface of the table. She took a white rag and wiped the table top until she was satisfied that it was clean.When I was a boy scout, we went fishing to a lake.  When we were on the lake (it was frozen), we decided to fish for some fish.  We drilled a hole into the lake and caught a lot.  We wanted to cook them, so we cleaned them out of all the nasty stuff in their body and started a fire.  When the fire was getting calmed down, the hot coals started to steam.  When it started steaming, we got the fish out and put it on a cast iron pan.  We put the pan on the middle of the fire with the lid on it and we waited while the fish cooked.  It smelled really good to us, especially with how hungry that we were.  After it started to smell almost burned, we took the pan off of the fire with hot gloves and ate the fish inside when cooled.While casually browsing through my friends pictures online I discovered a new revelation . They are called Lush bath bombs and the are colorful scented fizz balls . I quickly ordered a few online from their website and when they came I was overcome with excitement . I brought a Pink Potion one with a flower inside and a Blue Dream glitter one . I put the Hello Kitty tub stopper in my bath tub and ran my bathwater until the tub was halfway full . Then I dropped the bath bomb in the water and was anointed by the wonderful smell of lavender . The water in the tub fizzled with pretty blue glitter . I got in an soaked for more than an hour and got out feeling like a million bucks . I seemed to be a thousand times cleaner than I was before I got it . I even smelled great the whole entire day .I am so excited to learn how to drive today with Scott. We are in a large vacant parking lot and no one else is around so it will be perfectly safe for us, the car and anyone else. As we both get in the car, we put on our seatbelts. Check. Now he instructs me to put the key in the ignition and give it a gentle turn forward toward the front of the car. I hear the engine crank and can feel it hum. He tells me to grab the crankshaft and put it into the "D" position. I feel the car surge forward and immediately hit the brake pedal on the left and car stops. He tells me it's fine and to give it a little gas. The car begins to move forward as travel in a straight line. The more gas I give it from the pedal on the right, the faster we go!I love shopping online. Last weekend I wanted to order some vitamins. I looked on two web sites to find exactly the kind of vitamins I wanted. And I also looked at prices. I even tried to find some near me so that they would be shipped to me quick. The quickest way to get them and not have to pay too much money would cause them to get to me in four days. So I decided to order and wait. On Monday morning there was a package by my front door. I opened it. It was the vitamins. It took less than 24 hours for them to get to me. I was happy the vitamins were here. I tried to figure out how they go to me so quick. Then I figured out that they came from an Amazon facility near me. I might order from Amazon again since they got here quick.Last night I decided to make Mexican Bean Salad for dinner. This is a really nice, light, and flavorful dish to eat during the summer. I looked up the recipe and took out a notepad and a pen so I could make a list of all of the ingredients I needed to get at the grocery store on my way home from work. Some of the ingredients I already had - like olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, and cumin. However, I needed many of the other necessary ingredients in order to make the recipe. On my shopping list, I wrote that I needed one can of black beans, one can of kidney beans, one can of cannellini beans, a bag of frozen corn, one red onion, one green bell pepper, one red bell pepper, and one bunch of cilantro. I put the shopping list in my purse so I could reference it later at the store and make sure I buy everything that I need for dinner.This morning when I woke up, I noticed something was strange about my alarm clock.  Instead of being loud, like normal, it was fairly faint, and changing volume on it's own.  The light was also flickering a lot on the time readout.  I figured that the batteries were probably dying, so I decided to change them.  First, I looked in my cabinet to see if I had any spare batteries.  I didn't, so I drove to the grocery store to pick up some replacements.  I bought two AA batteries, and returned home with them.  I found my flat head  screwdriver in my tool box, and used it to pry open the battery compartment on the bottom of my alarm clock.  I then dislodged the old batteries with my fingers, and placed the new ones in the slots, with the positive and negative ends lining up appropriately.  Finally, I put the battery cover back on and saw the alarm clock light up brightly.I was invited for a party, and I had a very nice dress that I decided to wear. But when I saw, it has one button missing. So I had to fix it. That button had 4 holes, so I wanted to fix in such a way that it looks good. So I had to choose exact matching color with my dress. The button was golden. I started to sew it on back side so , the knot will not show up. Then I poke my needle in one of the hole and stretched my thread all the way, then I inserted the needle in to the opposite side of hole. When it went down, I pulled it all the way, and then, got it out from the hole as which was empty so far, and then from above again I will repeat the same thing and insert the thread opposite to that hole. I will continue doing that till I feel like it is strong then I will make knot and fix it firmly with button. my job was done.Baking a Birthday Cake For an Awesome Nephew It was the day before my nephew 's third birthday . I wanted to bake him a very special birthday cake . He loves tractors and anything related to farms , so I wanted to include that when I decorated the cake . I decided to make a cake with three layers since he was going to be three years old . I started by finding recipes for both chocolate and yellow cake since I knew that those were his favorites . I made the batter for the chocolate cake in one bowl and then the batter for the yellow cake in another bowl . I poured some chocolate cake batter in the largest and the smallest round baking pans since the top and bottom layers would be chocolate . I poured yellow cake batter in the medium-sized round baking pan since it would be the middle layer . I baked all three cakes and then cooled them . After they cooled , I stacked the cakes according to size and I frosted the bottom and top layers with yellow frosting and the middle layer with green frosting . I decorated the top of the cake with farm animals , a small toy tractor and the words , '' `` Happy Birthday Samuel . '' '' I topped off the cake with a number 3 candle . My nephew was very happy when he saw the cake . He was very surprised that I had baked a cake for him .At noon, my cat began to meow. He does this every single day around this time to signal that he's hungry and wants food. I got up from my chair and went to the kitchen. He followed me there, slinking in and out of my legs as I walked down the hall. I grabbed the box of food from on top of the freezer and took out one pouch. I tore it open and dumped the food into his bowl that sat on the ground next to the wall. He quickly began to eat the food. Meanwhile, I washed out his water bowl in the sink and filled it with fresh, cold water. Then, I sat it down onto the floor right next to his food bowl. He soon finished his food and purred in appreciation. He drank some water and then quickly ran out of the room to hide under the bed and take a nap.2 summers ago, my brother and went on a trip to stay with our aunt and her family for a whole week. We spent the entire week before we left preparing for this trip. The main thing that we needed to worry about was having clothes for the week. Knowing this, we got our suitcases, and made sure to set aside different clothes, including underwear, for just about each day of the next week. Then, we took some extra clothes for swimming just in case we would be doing this while we were over there. After the clothes, we made sure to pack our toiletries, like toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, and so on. We packed these in a small bag the day before we left. The last thing to pack was any other items we wanted to take with us. I decided to take a blanket, and my brother decided to take a pillow. We packed these into the suitcase, and once we were sure we had everything, we went off to our aunt's house.I had been putting of visiting a doctor because my regular primary care provider was nearly a mile away, and I owed the money that I simply did not have. I decide to visit an office that was much closer. I was so glad I did because they had sliding scale fee that drastically reduced the cost of doctor visits and specialists that I desperately needed to see. I filled out all the necessary paperwork and had a visit scheduled. The date came and I went to see my new primary care provider. I had anxiety as I always do when seeing a medical professional. She ended up being incredibly kind and understanding and she gave me a referral to see a chiropractor. I was so happy that I was finally going to be able to see someone to help with my back pain. I dislike narcotic painkillers and over the counter pain killers just don't cut it most days. overall it was a positive experience and rather comedic that I was actually scared.Samantha was so excited to go to her new friend's seventh birthday party; it was going to be Spider-Man themed and Samantha loved spider-man! The party was going to start in 1 hour and it was time for her to get ready to go, so she ran as fast as she could into her room to grab her party clothes. When she reached into her drawer to grab her prettiest dress- It was a beautiful pink color with pretty purple flowers and polka dots on it- she found that the dress looked ruined! It was wrinkled and bunched up from being shoved into her drawer for so long underneath all her other clothes. She ran to her mom in a panic, saying she couldn't make it to the party with a ruined dress! Her mom smiled and told her it was going to be okay, then she pulled out something she called an Ironing Board, which she explained would help her get the wrinkles out of the pretty dress without hurting it. Her mom ironed the dress and sure enough, it was then free of wrinkles and she was ready to go to the birthday party!I walk into the kitchen. I am hungry. It is still early in the morning, so breakfast would be appropriate. Eggs should do it. I open my refrigerator and grab 1 egg. I look in my cabinets and also grab a small pan. I put the pan on the stove and turn the knob on the side of the stove until the gas lights underneath my pan. I keep the fire low. While this heats up, I grab some butter from my refrigerator. I also get a spatula from my kitchen drawer. I scoop some butter out of the container with my spatula, then transfer the butter to the small pan. The butter begins to melt on the stove top. It is time to crack my egg and begin cooking. I crack my egg lightly on the counter top until the contents begin to ooze. I position my egg over the small pan and break the egg into two pieces, so that the egg lands on the small pan. I crack the yolk with my spatula. I then wait 3 minutes while the egg cooks. I sprinkle salt and pepper over the egg. When it is time, I flip the egg and repeat the process. When it is done, I remove the egg from the pan with my spatula and put the egg on a plate. It is time to eat.After a day of washing and drying clothes, I gathered aside the items of clothing to be hung up in a separate basket. I wanted to make sure to get rid of any wrinkles in them before hanging them up. I then brought the laundry basket upstairs and brought the ironing board out of the closet. I unfolded the ironing board and got out the iron from the closet as well. I brought the iron to the sink so I could fill it in order to use the steam function. I then brought the iron to set it upon the ironing board. I plugged the iron's cord into the socket. As I heard the iron start to heat up, I set the first item to be ironed on the board. I flattened the pants on the board so the creases would be right at the seams. As I grazed the iron across the pants, the wrinkles started to erase and I continued the process with the rest of the clothing items in the basket.This week we had bad weather from a tropical storm. My little boy was scared of the weather. Then, the lights went out, which made it much worse. In order to lessen the stress, I asked him if he would like to build a fort for us to play games in. He had the idea for us to eat pizza in the fort. Since our electricity was out, we could not bake one. We decided we could order a pizza. I gave him the choices of the crust and he chose thin crust. I gave him the choice of toppings and he just wanted pepperoni and cheese. I got his half with pepperoni and my half with vegetables. We put in our order and added some chicken bites, for some extra protein. We built our fort while we waited for the pizza to arrive. The pizza came and we had a pizza fort party by lantern light. I was an amazing memory from a situation that was less than positive.I decided to make dinner for my family this Friday night. I had a few ingredients for making spaghetti but I still needed spaghetti sauce and bread rolls. I already had the noodles at my house. I drove my car to my nearest supermarket. I grabbed a shopping cart and entered the store. I strolled the aisles until I found the Italian food isle. I looked around for my favorite spaghetti sauce and found it. i put it into my shopping cart and proceeded to go to the bakery section. I ordered some freshly baked Italian bread rolls. I put all the items into my shopping cart and started making my way towards the cashier check out. I placed my items on the cashier desk and paid for my items. After paying I went back to my car in the parking lot and placed the items inside my car. I drove home and started boiling the pasta and heating up the spaghetti sauce. I put the bread into the oven to heat it up. After 20 minutes the meal was ready and I sat down at the table with my family and enjoyed the meal. When I was done I washed the dishes and dinner was finished.Yes going on a train , this is was our ideal weekend activity not too long ago . We purchased tickets to travel from Boston to New York City . As we entered the platform of the train is was pure steel and looked so solidly strong . We walked down the isle and found an comfortable looking seat and decided to sit there . Shortly the train horn blasted making me jump of my seat lol . Anyway we soon started moving and our train ride was underway . The conductor walked the isles and collected our tickets . love scenery so I had the window seat watching everything along the way . First I saw large suburban areas but as we got into Connecticut many farms were being spotted . It was n't very hilly but sure was a country atmosphere . Soon we approached NYC and the train came to slow stop , we had arrived at our destination . The ride overall was rather smooth and it did n't seem to take all that long .I saw from my alarm clock that it was time to feed my fish. I tend to feed them every day at 5:00 pm. I walked over to the tank to see how they were doing. They were swimming around and ready to be fed. I grabbed my jar of fish food and screwed the cap. Then I scooped out just enough food to feed them for one day. The scooped food went right into the water. My fish were in a slight frenzy to get fed. They swam all at once to the surface to eat up the food that I had given them. In a short while, most of the food had disappeared from the surface of the water. The fish appeared to be eating healthily so i began to put things away. I then closed the top of the tank, and replaced the cap on the fish food. I put the food away for another day.Every month, I have to make sure to always pay all my bills. Being an adult, this is one of the responsibilities you have to do. There are several bills I have to pay each month with money I earn from working. They include: my mortgage, car payment, cell phone, TV/internet, electric, and credit card bills. I set some time aside to check what I owe on each bill. The mortgage is usually the highest. Most bills I can pay online by using my computer. I go the the website, enter an amount, and within a few clicks, it is paid for. My car payment doesn't have an easy-to-use online pay system, so for that I use my checkbook. I take a check and write out the amount, who I am paying it to (the bank), and sign my name. I then put the check in an envelope with the bank's address on it, attach a stamp, and drop it off at my local mail box. It's not a long, or hard task, but it's something I must do each month.When ever I want to make any reservation, I always do online, so I can get good deals. I first went to travel sites ( trip advisor ) to see if any good deal is there. I am planning to travel from Atlanta to Singapore. I note down some fares, and then I visited expedia and dunhill travel sites. . I liked the tripadvisor, after reviewing the site, and looking at the customer reviews. The number was on site. When I first talked to him, he gave me some options I  think I got good deal, $1300 for round trip with stop at London for 14 hours and then directly to Singapore. I liked that way because I wanted to see London also.  It was good timing that I could go out see London and come back, and still I was left with ease. I asked the agent, about any delaying problem, and cancellation. He told me if I add more $50 dollars, then I can change or cancel my trip without any penalty , and I did.My alarm clock is not working. I think it's the batteries. I have some extra batteries in the utility drawer. I open the drawer and find the right size. As I sit down at my desk, with the batteries, I notice the back of the alarm clock where the batteries are is crooked. I try to straighten that first but the alarm clock is still not working. I have to assume it must be the batteries. I take the old batteries out of the alarm clock and look them over for corrosion. They look fine, so maybe they are just old. I place the new batteries in the alarm clock and I make sure they make contact with the metal parts and face the right direction. Check. I slide the back of the alarm clock back on and flip the clock over. I turn the on switch on and it lights up. All I have to do now is reset the time and I'm good to go.Terri likes to vacuum the carpet, it is one of her chores she does every other day.  After school, she has a small list of little chores to do around the house.  She has to vacuum the living room and hallway for those days.  So, on one of these days, she takes out the vacuum cleaner, unwinds the cord, plugs it in, and adjusts the height of the vacuum.  This way, it is low to the ground, and gets all the dirt up.  She then hits the button for start, and it turns on.  She pushes it gently across the carpet and floors of the living room and hallway. She makes sure that she gets the edges and under any carpets that are movable. She also vacuums under the front of the couch.  When she is done, she turns off the machine, empties the dirt into the trash can, and pops the container back onto the vacuum.  She rolls up the cord, and returns it back to the closet.Cooking fish is a fun and cool activity that many people can do because there are so many steps. First the step is to find a good sized fish. Now I know what your thinking, and you cannot just grab any ole fish out of a tank or something you found in a stream. You need a good fish with lots of meat and food on it. My favorite fish to cook is probably drum, so once you have a good nice drum you first have to cut it. Get all the meat off of it and then there are a number of ways to cook it. I like to fry my fish, so I season it with a number of thinks and then make sure to cover it in flour and bread crumbs. I then heat the oil I will be using to fry it to a very hot temperature and then dunk the fish in the oil until it is nice and brown.We are going on a trip to Six Flags. We will be staying for two nights in a hotel so we need to pack. The suitcases are stored in the walk-in closet so they are brought out into the living room. We need to decide what kind of clothing we'll need, so let's turn on the Weather Channel. Since it is going to be very warm with no rain during our trip we will pack mostly summer clothes. Each person will need three shorts and tops so there are clothes for each day and an extra outfit if needed. Fold everything nicely so it does not wrinkle and all clothing fits in the suitcase. Let's move on to the bathroom and pack tooth care supplies like a toothbrush, mouthwash, and toothpaste. Deodorant , make-up, perfume, and cologne also go in now. Put these items in the side pocket of the suitcase to be reached quickly. Everyone pack one sweatshirt and light jacket in case it is colder at night. Grab swimsuits and trunks too, for the water park, and bring sandals and sneakers. Now all we have to do is pack our towels for the water park, get the tickets and money packed, and leave the house to start our trip.Before making the bed, I wash all of my sheets, pillowcases, and blankets. While they are drying, I Febreeze the mattress and pillows to freshen up the fabric and make sure nothing smells stuffy. Once the sheets are dry, I begin by putting on the fitted sheet. I spread it out evenly and flat, and then lay down the flat sheet over the fitted sheet. I pull all of the corners, make sure everything lines up. I Febreeze the down comforter, and then tie back on the corners of the duvet cover. I button up the duvet cover, pulling the buttons inside so they don't get caught on anything. I lay out the duvet cover on top of the sheets, and then put the smaller blanket, folded, at the foot at the bed. I put the pillowcases back on each of the pillows, and place the pillows at the head of the bed. I take a final look, and straighten everything out again to be symmetrical and neat.Last night I decided I was going to go dancing. My husband, daughter, sisters and their husbands and nieces went out to a nice place where a lot of people go. We got to the place we were going dancing. There was a guy at the door checking ID's to make sure there wasn't anyone under the age of 21 going in. Of course we were all over 21 so there weren't any issues. We all went in and found us a table. We then decided to order some drinks and about that time a waitress came over and asked us what we would like to have. We all gave her our order and she went to get the drinks. While she was away a good song started playing and we all decided to dance. We all went out on the dance floor and danced until the end of the song. We went back to our table and our drinks arrived as soon as we got back. We all drank our drink and decided to dance some more. We stayed for a few hours and danced. We all then decided it was time to go home. We all went to the door. We told one another bye and we all left and went home.I woke up with my alarm and sluggishly got out of bed. I went to the bathroom and turned out the light. I went to the shower and turned the water on. While it was warming up I got a towel from the closet and undressed. I stepped into the shower and grabbed the bottle of shampoo I keep on the ledge. I squirt some into my hand, about the size of a quarter. I wet my hair and then rub in the shampoo. I scrub my hair and can feel all the suds forming on my head. After a few minutes of this I carefully rinse the soap out of my hair. I don't want to get it in my eyes. I then grab my bottle of conditioner and repeat what I did with the shampoo. This time though I leave it sit for a couple minutes so many hair can soak up those nutrients. I then rinse off again making sure there's no soap what so ever left.  I shut off the shower and dry off, my hair now squeaky clean.I did laundry earlier in the day and now there was a pile of laundry to put away laying on my bed.  First I sorted everything and hung up the clothes that went on hangers in the closet.  Then I folded t-shirts.  First I laid them flat, then i folded on arm inwards and then the other.  Then I folded the bottom of the shirt upward and the top downwards.  After shirts, I moved on to underpants.  I folded them halfways from the center and then top to bottom.  Next came pants.  I lined up the seams and folded them in half longways, and then from the top to the center then the bottom to the center.  I matched up socks and laid one on top of the other.  Then I took the cuffs about a third of the way down to keep each with it's matching partner.  Then I put my folded clothes away in drawers.When I cooked pasta last, I had a great experience. I was with my girlfriend and we were in the mood for pasta and meat sauce. In order to do this, we first picked the pasta out of the cabinet and opened up the box. We then boiled the water, before putting the pasta in. As we put the pasta in, we stirred it and watched the water boil. After putting in spices and watching the pasta for about five to ten minutes, we tried one piece of pasta to see if it was soft enough to eat. Upon trying the food and enjoying the taste, we put the meat sauce on the pasta and let it get hot. Upon both the pasta and the sauce getting hot, we put it all on bowls and ate the pasta. This tasted amazing and I felt that it was perfectly tasty and hot.This morning my wife would not make the bed so I had to. I think she was being lazy. I tore the old sheets off the bed and threw them into the washing machine. It took a while to find clean sheets. They were in the linen closet as they should be. I put the new sheets on the bed and my wife did not like how I put the sheets on and then did it herself. We talked about how old the bed was and talked about buying a new bed. We helped each other put the blankets on the bed. I put the pillows on the bed, but my wife did not like how I arranged them. So she arranged the pillows how she wanted them. Later I saw her in bed. She said that she thought she was sick. So I brought her breakfast in bed. She smiled.I had a pile of clothes that needed to be washed. First I separated the white clothes from the colored clothes. I washed the white clothes first. I put the clothes into the washing machine. I then put laundry soap in. I also put about a cup of bleach in. Bleach helps make the white clothes stay white. I turned on the washing machine by setting the dial to the the amount of time to wash the clothes. I also set a knob for how full the washer was. I also set the temperature of the water. After the clothes were done washing I put them into the dryer. I set the dryer for 30 minutes because I think that is how long it will take to try them. I did everything above for the colored clothes except put in bleach. I only washed 2 loads of clothes.This weekend I went to a bonfire with my friends. It was the weekend before graduation so there was a lot of people present there. I knew most of the people since I've grown up with them. We had a really good time. We all sat around the bonfire and ate snacks while sharing stories of old times. We also talked about what the future could hold for all of us. We were starting on a new road soon, we were all getting a fresh start, and it was so very exciting. I couldn't wait to start college in the fall as I'm sure most of my friends felt the same way. I was having such a great night though, I was sad that it would soon come to an end and it could be years before I saw all those people again. I felt happy though that I went to the bonfire.I set a pan on the stove and grab a plastic bowl from the cupboard over the stove and set it on the counter adjacent to the stove top. I open the refrigerator and grab two eggs out of the carton. Cracking the eggs against the side of the dish gently and then open them over the bowl, making sure there is no shell in the bowl I then toss the shells into the trash can behind me. I put a splash of cream, milk or water into the eggs and then beat them furiously with a fork or whisk. I then grab the soft butter from next to the toaster and put one pat into the pan. I turn the burner on and once the butter starts to sizzle I pour the beaten eggs into the pan, add a little salt and pepper and wait until they are semi firm. I then grab a spatula and chop the eggs up and let the carry over heat cook the eggs the rest of the way.Yesterday my wife and I wanted to watch a new movie that had just hit the video stands.  I went to the local store which had a Red Box video vending machine outside of it.  I looked over the selections it had till I found the one I wanted.  I put my credit card into the slot for paying and purchased a copy of the movie to watch.  I took the copy from the machine and headed home after stopping at the store to buy some popcorn for the movie.  I placed it into the DVD and watched the movie while enjoying the popcorn.  The movie and the popcorn were great.  When I was done I popped the DVD out of the machine and went back to the store to return the movie to the Red Box video vending machine.  It was an excellent experience and I will definitely do it again.I sometimes put a gift in a box, if it doesn't already have one, to make it easier to wrap. It's nice to put tissue paper inside the box, too. That makes opening the gift more interesting. After I have the gift boxed, I assemble my wrapping supplies. I use rolled wrapping paper, clear tape, scissors, and ribbon. Next, I unroll some wrapping paper and place the gift box on top of the flat paper. I  study it, trying to figure out how much paper to cut off the roll. I don't want to waste paper, but I also want to neatly cover the gift. Once I decide how much paper to cut off, I mark the place with pencil, then fold there, and cut the paper along the fold line. Now I turn the gift upside down, and position it in the center of my paper. I pull up one end of the paper, and tape it to the center bottom of the box. I pull the other end of the paper smooth, pull it around  the box and tape it in place too. Then I do the ends of the package, folding the paper down, cutting it shorter if I must, and smoothing it neatly around the gift box. I tape it in place, and decorate the box with pretty ribbon and bows to distract from any mistakes I may have made.Today, I had to pack a suitcase. I put all of my favorite things into it, as I was going to be gone for a very, very long time. In fact, I'm not sure when I will return to the location that I am in right now. I first entered my toiletries, including my tooth brush, hair brush, and deodorants. I also threw some cologne in there. Then, I added my clothes, including pants, shirts, socks, underwear - boxers, not briefs. Additionally, I added shaving cream, a few snacks, my electronics, including my phone, my phone charger, my electric razor charger, and batteries for my phone, as an additional comfort for when I cannot get a charge. I also loaded up with a couple pillows and a nice blanket, for this luxurious vacation. Hopefully I will be enjoying my trip, and with a suitcase as full as this one, I better.Yesterday afternoon, my sister and I went to the outdoor neighborhood swimming pool. The pool requires that visitors either live in the neighborhood or be guests of a neighborhood resident in order to enter, and because we met those criteria, we had no problems getting in. The day was sunny and above eighty degrees. I wore my teal one-piece swimsuit and my sister wore her pink bikini. After we had walked to the pool from our house, we both lathered up with sunscreen and laid our towels and pool bags on vacant lounge chairs. There were only a dozen people at the pool. One of them was my sister's friend, so she left immediately to go splash around with her and hang out on a raft. I ordered a raspberry smoothie and laid out with my copy of "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" while the sun heated my skin. When I started to sweat, I rinsed off in the provided shower and then put on my goggles and got into the pool to swim laps. Thankfully, the lap swim lane was clear, and I got a good work-out in. The day started to cloud over, and my sister's friend left, so after that the two of us sat in the shallow end of the pool with the warm water rising to our shoulders and chatted until we had both had our fill of pool time. We wrapped ourselves in our towels, put our flip-flops on, and walked home from the pool.Now we stood here in the line in front of the large glass window with people inside. Once our turn came up, we bought tickets to the movie we wanted to watch. The showtime wasn't for another 30 minutes. So we decided to go the arcade next door and play some games. They have real old classic arcade games there.  Remember Galaga? Donkey Kong? Even the old Star Wars simulator. That was my favorite game when I was a kid...  Once we're inside the theater, we bought some candies, popcorn, and some drinks. With our hands full with goodies, we headed into viewing room. It was already packed with people. We find a pair of good seats towards the back. There are nice old couple seated towards the aisle. We approached the seats and asked with a smile, "Can we get by here? Thank you." Nice folks replied with a smile and said, "Why of course my dear, Go on in." We sat down and enjoyed the movie with a handful of popcorn and an occasional slurp of the soda.The last time that I washed dishes, I first rounded up all of the dishes and placed them in the sink. I then went one by one until they were all washed. I first put water on them and then soap and I used the sponge to clean them thoroughly. I lathered the sponge all over each dish and then put them each aside after I was done. After drying each one, I put it aside to dry. Soon after, everything was cleaned and I was able to start putting everything away. I put everyone in the same spot that it always goes in and this continued in this example as well. I let everything dry and I put it exactly where it belonged.This process was somewhat time consuming, but overall, it was a routine and easy process. I was able to wash all of the dishes and feel comfortable using them.When my baby was born, I knew I would be learning a lot of new things. She woke up in the middle of the night because she was hungry. I picked her up from her crib and held her close as I walked towards the rocking chair in the nursery. I pulled down the shoulder of my nightgown and unhooked the nursing bra I was wearing so the baby could latch onto my breast and eat. She didn't like having a bottle, so nursing was our best option to keep her happy and fed. She nursed for half an hour and slowly, as she got full, her eyes started to droop shut. I started to sing her a lullaby, soft and sweet, and she soon fell asleep. I wiped some milk from the corner of her mouth with a tissue, and set her back down in her crib so she could sleep until it was time to eat again.To remove and replace a garbage bag, first lift the full garbage bag from the garbage can. Some garbage bags have ties or strings that are attached to them and can be used to close the top of the garbage bag by pulling on the strings until the opening completely closes. Then the ends of the strings can be tied in a knot so the bag will not open. If the bag does not have strings attached, use a twist tie to close the opening by gathering the top of the bag together and wrapping the twist tie around the end of the bag and twisting the ends of the twist tie together. Take the full, closed garbage bag outside so the garbage man can pick it up. Then, take a new garbage bag out of the box and unfold it before putting it in the garbage can. You can fold the top edge of the garbage bag over the rim of the can so that garbage does not get between the can and the bag.I love to make hot chocolate in the wintertime. Today it snowed so I decided to make myself a mug of hot cocoa. Some people just put a mug of water in the microwave and then add Swiss Miss. Not me. I use milk in mine. First I put the milk in a sauce pan. Then I put it on the burner on medium high heat. While the milk is heating up I get mix cocoa and sugar together. I have to be careful while boiling milk because once I did it for too long. Then a skin formed on top and it was gross. I learned after that that as soon as it boils I need to pull it off the burner.Once the milk comes to a boil I pour it into a mug. Then I add the cocoa. Then I stir and enjoy it in front of my fireplace.Sally just got her pay check in the mail and she felt like she deserved to go shopping and treat herself to something nice. The shopping centre was a little bit of a drive from her home but she thought that it was worth all the gas money. When sally got to the shopping centre she saw clothes, new phones, and books! She was so excited to be there she had not gone to this particular shopping centre before. Sally's first thought was to go to the book store and see what kind of new hits that she wanted to read. She made it to the book section and picked out a book that was titled: the magical uses and wonders of Flippity Floppity Bibbity Boppity Boo. and she thought it was wonderful so she brought it up to the counter and paid for the book. Sally was getting tired after all that shopping so she got back in her car and went home. she had to stop at the gas station to fuel up her car and then when she was done, she got back in the car and drove home. she was very tired so she went to sleep. Goodnight Sally.Today was the start of Spring, so I decided it was time to get some cleaning done. The first and largest thing to deal with was my apartment flat. I started by picking up any loose items that were not in their proper place. I put as many items into drawers and closets as possible to reduce clutter. I then moved all the furniture so I could clean the floors where the furniture is normally sitting. I vacuumed the exposed floor then moved the furniture back into place with a couple changes in the arrangement for fun. Then I swept the rest of the floor after dusting any surfaces that needed it. Afterwards, I cleaned all the windows, inside and out, and moved to the bathroom. After wiping down all the surfaces in the bathroom with a disinfecting cleaner, I took a look around my flat to assess my work. My apartment was now clean and it felt great!Cleaning the table is done after every meal. Sometimes people make a big mess when they eat and sometimes not. It sometimes depends on what we eat. Usually I like to get the plates off the table first. If there is not much food left on the plates then I will stack them on top of each other with the dirtiest plate on top. And I take the dishes to the sink. Next I get the silverware and take them to the sink. If there is food left I remove the food from the table and put the food into bowls to be saved in the refrigerator as left overs. Glasses, coffee cups and dessert plates will be removed from table. Sometimes there are place mats to be removed or a table cloth. One of the last things to do is wipe the table to make sure it is clean.I had been wanting to get my tattoo fixed for 5 years now and I just couldn't seem to save up the several hundred dollars it would cost to get it fixed. The other day it dawned on mt that I could buy my own tattoo machine online. I researched tattoo machines, needles and inks for the better part of a month at different online retailers before I decided on a retailer. I then researched the product and how to use it for a few more weeks. I watched videos about the product, tutorials and user reviews. I figured since I am an artist and pretty good at drawing and tracing that I would give it a go. I saved up amazon gift cards for several more weeks. It took a while but I eventually saved the better part of a hundred dollars, one dollar gift card at a time. I decided to finally make my purchase and the product arrived two days later.This morning I woke up and all the covers were off my bed. Even though I don't normally make up my bed, this morning it was necessary. I decided to change my sheets, since they were off anyway. First, I removed all the sheets and comforter. I placed the comforter on the side. I gathered up the sheets and pillow cases and brought them to the laundry. Next, I got out another set of clean sheets. I unfolded the fitted sheet, that has elastic around the edges. I stretched the sheet over each corner, making a nice tight area. Next, I put the flat sheet on, tucking in the bottom and the sides. Next, I replaced the comforter, being sure that all the sides were hanging over the same amount. I put clean pillow cases on the pillows and put them at the head of my bed. Now, my bed was beautifully made with clean sheets!One time in a restaurant I had to send the food back. Let me tell you what happened. Well, it was over one week ago, last Tuesday. I had put on my very best tie that morning before I went to my place of work. Then, I went out for lunch. You see, lunch time is a time of the day when you get to get out of your desk to move around and get to go to places that will serve you food. Well at this place they served me a pumpkin. I said to the waiter, this is not what I had placed my order for. The waiter said that he was sorry and took the pumpkin back. Then he brought out the grilled salmon that I had ordered. I was suspicious of the salmon because what restaurant accidentally serves a pumpkin instead of a grilled salmon. That does not inspire confidence.I walked into the living room ,and the carpet was dirty. it was bothering me so I decided to clean it . I got the vacuum and first made sure that there was no garbage in bag. It was, so I cleaned it. First I made sure that there were no nails or big stuff lying around the room. I picked them up. I plugged  it in the it in the power outlet.  I turned on the vacuum. I cleaned in rows, so I do not skip any area. Then, I attached flat vacuum to clean the sides of walls and the area under the furniture. the sound was very loud  I placed  the bottom of the vacuum on the carpet . I vacuumed all of the carpet and it was finally all clean . I called my family to all look at it. It was good and I was finally done with it.This weekend , I decided I wanted to try baking my first cake . I found a recipe online for an easy to make cake , printed out a list of the ingredients , and went to the grocery store to get them . I knew about some of the common things , like eggs , flour , and sugar , but the list helped me get a lot of things I did n't own and would n't know to get . When I got home , I followed the recipe as closely as I could , adding each of the ingredients at the exact amount of the recipe asked for . I mixed them all up as described , and put them into a pan that I had borrowed from my mother . I put the pan in the oven and let the cake cook . I checked on it occasionally to see if it was looking OK , and because I was really excited to see how it was turning out . When it was done in the oven I removed it , and applied an extra thick coat of frosting . I was supposed to wait for the cake to cook , but I was too excited to try it out and ate it much sooner than recommended . It was delicious !One day our family decided to go on a one-day outing.  We got into the car and buckled our seat belts.  Dad put his car key into the ignition slot on the side of the steering wheel and started the car.  He carefully backed out of the driveway, using the side rear view mirror to watch for oncoming traffic.  He put the car into the D slot to move forward and we were off on our trip.  Dad drove in the right lane on the freeway most of the way.  When he wanted to pass another car, he used his turn signal to signal that he was going to change lanes and pass.  After passing the other car, he would use his turning signal to signal that he was getting back into the right lane.  It started to rain and he used his windshield wipers to clear the window.I knew he was sick because he told me so. It didn't help that he was coughing and sneezing. He hadn't been able to get out of bed for days. It looked like he had a fever. He had gone to the doctor a few days ago. He had a prescription from them, but he wasn't able to take the medicine himself. He needed it. I went to the cupboard we kept it in and took out the medicine. It was in a small bottle. The medicine was liquid, so it was easy to administer. I opened the bottle. Then I measured out a single dose into its cap. I set the cap of medicine down on the counter before grabbing a small glass of water. With both the medicine and the water in my hand, I went back to his room. He opened his mouth for me. I pressed the cap to his mouth, making sure he drank all of it. Then he had some water.On a Tuesday afternoon I had a flight reservation to go to Cancun Mexico. So I took a taxi to the airport and arrived there 3 hours early because when you have an international flight that is the require time.  I made my way to where my airline was located at and I decided to use one of the self check in kiosk which make it very easy to check in. All that you need is to have your passport ready if you are going to be going on an international flight if not all you need is a photo ID but in this case my flight was international. After your boarding pass is printed you need to take your luggage to get it checked in a well and it gets weighted and if its over the specific weight that is allowed you might be asked t pay an excess weight fee.Mary makes her bed up every weekend with new sheets from her mother's sheet closet.  She goes to the closet, picks out some nice clean sheets, with her favorite colors, and carries two sheets and two pillow cases to the bedroom.  She takes off the old sheets from her bed, and puts them in the hamper to be washed.  She then takes the fitted sheet with the rounded corners, and throws it onto the bed.  She pulls the corners down around the corners of the bed until it is tight. Then she puts the top sheet on her bed and tucks in the bottom part of her top sheet.  Then she takes the pillow cases and puts one on each pillow, to make a fresh clean bed.  She puts her cover on last, it is a blue one with little flowers.  She loves it, it came from her grandmother from Christmas. She fluffs the pillows and puts her favorite teddy bear to rest on the pillows as decoration.The grass on our front lawn was beginning to get tall and thick, so before it grew any higher, I thought it would be a good idea to cut it.  I decided to pull out our lawnmower from the shed in our backyard.  There are several kinds of lawnmowers, but the kind of lawnmower we own in gas-powered.  Because our lawnmower had no gas in it, I pulled a gas storage container off of a high shelf in our backyard shed and filled the gas tank.  To start the lawnmower, I pulled the starting cable vigorously a few times.  The lawnmower's motor roared to loud life and I began pushing it through the grass in the yard in a methodical back-and-forth pattern so the grass would be evenly and neatly cut.  This made our front yard look so good, I decided to mow the backyard's lawn as well!This morning I took a shower because I was dirty from playing outside. I got undressed and turned on the shower. I put my hand in the water to see if it was too hot or too cold. Then, I got in the shower and got myself wet all over. I found the shampoo and put some of it on my hand. Then, I rubbed by hands on my hair until it was all soapy. After I was done with that, I rinsed my hair to get all the soap out. Then, I found the bath soap and rubbed it all over my body. I did my face, my underarms and my stomach. I also did my legs and my feet. After I was done getting soapy all over, I used the water to rinse all the soap from my body. When I was done, I turned off the shower and dried myself off with a towel. Then, I got dressed in clean clothes. I felt better after I took the shower because I was clean.As I was preparing breakfast , I noticed that I was out of a lot of things that are staples in the preparation of most other dishes . Bread , milk , and things of that nature . So after I was done with breakfast , I sat down to prepare a grocery shopping list . I thought of all the things off the top of my head that I would need , and then I perused through my cupboards and refrigerator to fill in the blanks . Once I was satisfied with my list , I got dressed and got in my car . I drove to the grocery store and parked . I grabbed a cart and pulled my shopping list out of my purse . I went up and down the aisles , placing things in the cart as I went . Once I had everything , I went to the checkout counter . I put all my things on the belt and a bagger bagged them as the cashier scanned . The bagger set the bags in my cart , and I took the bags out to my car . Once I got home , I brought the bags inside and put all the groceries away . This is how I went grocery shopping .Keeping a clean bathroom to me is an important part of good hygiene. This is something that I had to do just recently. I noticed that the toilet and counters were stained, and that the mirrors were filthy. I then set aside all of the necessary cleaners to use in the bathroom, and got to work. I first worked on the counter tops. I used a special marble cleaner to clean them, and it really made them shine. After the counters, I did the mirrors. I used a very strong glass cleaner to get the job done, and by the time I finished, the mirrors were spotless. Lastly, I took care of the toilet. I cleaned the outside of it with the same marble cleaner I used on the counters, and used a special toilet bowl cleaner for the inside of the bowl. Just for good measure, I mopped the floor of the bathroom, washed out the bathtub with shower cleaner, and sprayed the room with air freshener to make it smell nice.It is time to make the bed.  First I take the pillows off of the bed and place them  on the floor of my bed room.  I pull the blanket and flat sheet off of the bed and set it on top of the pillows.  The only thing on the bed is now the fitted sheet.  I go to one corner of the bed and untuck the corner of the fitted sheet so I can shake  the sheet 3 times before putting it back on the corner of the mattress. I put the flat sheet on the bed first, making sure its flat with no wrinkles.  I put the blanket on top of the sheet, making sure it is on the bed straight with no wrinkles.   I tuck the sheet and blanket under the mattress at the bottom of the bed, The pillows are placed at the top of the bed.I was going for a long drive, so I knew my car would need more fuel than it already had. I pulled into the station and checked the dash to be sure I knew what side the tank was on before I parked next to one of the pumps. I pulled the lever inside to open the panel for the gas cap and hopped out of my car. I paid for my fuel at the pump using a credit card, and unscrewed the gas cap. I slid the nozzle into the fuel tank and started to pump. I watched the gauge carefully to be sure I knew how much I was getting, and how much money I was spending. When I had a full tank, the pump stopped all on its own! I put the nozzle back in the holster on the side of the, screwed the gas cap back in place, and closed the panel. I was ready for my trip!Yesterday evening, my friend Jasmine called me on my cell phone. We talked about so many things and we were on the phone for about 2 hours. She asked me how life was ever since I moved from Denver to Atlanta. I told her that life had been amazing and the only thing that sucks, is the horrible traffic. Jasmine also mentioned that she will be visiting me next month for a week long vacation. I was so excited to hear that I will have a visitor because sometimes it can get lonely not having family in the same city as you. I told Jasmine that I will plan to take her to some of the best restaurants in town and plan a big shopping trip. During our phone call, we also talked about the days when we were in college together. After a while of talking, we decided that it was time to get off the phone and take care of some things at home. I really enjoyed our conversation.Last weekend, my wife and I had some friends over.  After the party ended, we decided that we wanted to watch a movie.  I decided to run to the Redbox booth to get a new movie that was out.  I got my keys and went to the booth.  I paid with my card for the movie that we wanted.  I drove back to our house and I got the DVD out of the case.  I own a PS4, so I placed the DVD right into the machine without opening the console.  I had to get the controller out of a drawer to play, but I found it easy to find out where to start the movie.  We all relaxed on the couch and ate some candy while we watched the movie.  We laughed at the funny parts and stayed awake for the whole movie, even when it got a little boring.It was time for my cat to eat her dinner. Her name is Gracie. When it's time for her to eat, she will meow constantly and paw at her food bowl. She also will follow you sometimes. When I noticed her doing this, I walked to the kitchen cabinet where her food is kept and pulled out one small can of tuna and chicken flavored wet cat food, which is her favorite. She saw that I did this and affectionately brushed up against my legs. I opened the can using the pull tab on top of the lid, and used a spoon to scrape all of the food out of the can and into her food dish. She immediately went to her dish, and had eaten all of her food within a few minutes. I also placed water into her water bowl, which she lapped up after finishing her cat food.My dad is a great cook and one of the things he knows how to cook good is fish. Sometimes he buys the fish from the supermarket and sometimes he buys the fish from the fish market.  When he buys it from the supermarket he buys it by the pound and it is usually already cut up into pieces and cleaned up.  When he buys it from the fish market he has to clean it out more and take out the bones. Some of the fish he buys still has the head, fins and tail so he has to cut those parts out too. The head of the fish is really good to make fish soup. I like it better when he leaves the scales (skin) of the fish as it tastes really good. There are many different ways that he cooks the fish. Sometimes he will  fry it in a pan or deep fry the fish and also put some bread crumbs on the fish before frying it.  He also bakes the fish in the oven which makes it soft and tender. My favorite is when dad steams the fish a little bit and we eat it semi-raw like sushi.  In the summer time dad will also throw some fish on the grill and barbeque it.  My mom told me that eating fish is really good for you as it has a lot of essentials vitamins and oils and eating fish makes you live longer and is also god for your brain.I was really hungry.  I decided to make a pot of soup.  I had some leftover chicken in the fridge so I took it out and brought it to the chopping board.  I put a pot of water on the stove to boil.  After I chopped the chicken, I threw it into the boiled water.  I added a little chicken stock and seasoning.  I went to the fridge and grabbed some carrots, celery and onions.  I brought the veggies back to the chopping board as well.  I chopped up the vegetables into small chunks.  When the veggies were all cut, I threw them into the pot.  I let the vegetables cook down for a while.  The soup was starting to smell good.  When it was almost done, I threw in some noodles.  In just a few minutes, the chicken noodle soup was ready to eat.  It tasted amazing and I ate it all!It was a morning just like any other, and there was no reason that it should not be. I brushed the dust of my eyes and walked into the sun lit kitchen, the rays of shun beading in through the blind of the 2nd story window. I reminisced of an earlier time when I first moved in. The world was new in a sense, and I can  vividly see myself the morning I first awoke in my new home. I went to making scrambled eggs, and these eggs were not any ordinary eggs. They were the most amazing eggs that I have ever had the pleasure of eating. It was not just the combination of being in a new place and starting new that made the eggs better. It was as if in that moment in my life, everything synced together so perfectly, that these scrambled eggs I made were just the cherry on top of my life's Sunday.Today was my birthday and I received a card from my friend who lives in India. I wanted to reply to her card and thank her for remembering me on my birthday. As I started writing I started to remember the wonderful time we had together when we were young. I started writing to her about our picnic and the movie we saw together. I started remembering all the things we did together. It made me very happy. I finished the letter and got ready to go and post it. Nowadays most of the people have stopped writing letters. They all keep in touch through emails. Letters are something very personal. We can preserve the letters of our loved ones and some beautiful memories along with it.  Slowly letter writing has been taken over by messages, Facebook and emails, WhatsApps etc. I and my friend only write letters to each other because we feel this is a better way to keep in touch.We had just come home from the beach one Saturday afternoon . We had a great time , but were very sweaty , sandy and sticky with old sunscreen , sweat and salt from the ocean . After unpacking the car , I had to take a bath . I love our deep soaking tub . I put in the drain plug and started running the water , making sure the temperature of the water was just right , and put in my favorite bath scents and soap . When the tub was full , I immersed myself deep into the tub and just let my body soak for a while . It was good to sit in the nice , warm water and let everything just relax and melt away from me . I washed my hair with my favorite shampoo , as I had a lot of sand in it from playing at the beach that day . I scrubbed my body well with a washcloth , to get off all the sand and ocean salt that had dried on my skin , along with the sunscreen that I had been using . It was very relaxing and I felt really good . I then pulled the drain on the tub and let all the dirty water go down . I had a big , fluffy bath towel that I dried off in , and I put on clean clothes . I was ready to finish up our fun day with some dinner and good times with my family .I own a giant, diesel, 4 door truck that is red in color and mean in appearance. I work construction for my job so I need to have something that is able to tow and haul a lot of weight. One of the unfortunate side effects of owning such a large, mean truck, however, is the need to constantly put fuel in it! I usually go to the gas station twice a week to fill up my tank and empty my wallet. I pick a pump at my favorite gas station that is easy to drive into so I don't risk hitting other vehicles. I hop out and insert my credit card into the pump machine. After my card is read, I pull the gas nozzle off of the machine and insert it into my truck. I wait for what seems like forever as the pump fills my tank and the dollar amount endlessly increases.When I was at camp last summer, I wasn't allowed to use email, so I had to write a letter to my parents to tell them that I wanted to come home. I sat on my bunk with my notebook propped against my knees and thought about what I wanted to say. After a few minutes, I decided I knew what I wanted to say, so I picked up my pen and started moving it across the paper. First I put the date in the upper right hand corner. Then I wrote "Dear Mom and Dad" on the first line. I kept writing all the words I needed to use in order to convince my parents to let me come home. Then I signed the letter with my name. I folded the letter in half and then folded it in half again so that it would fit in an envelope. Then I put the letter in an envelope. I taped the envelope shut. Then I stuck a stamp on the upper right corner of the envelope. I wrote my parent's address on the middle of the envelope and then I walked to the camp office and gave my letter to the secretary so she could mail it for me.My family went for a picnic on Sunday. My parents had packed food for us to eat at the picnic. We went to a Mountain which was around 30 miles from my home. It was around 11 am when we reached the mountain. There was a small pond with lots of ducks. My brother and me played for some time in the water. We played hide and seek for some time. My family was having a good time, all of us were chatting, playing and singing. It was around 1 pm. We were hungry now. We washed our hands and took out the food which my parents had packed. My mother laid out the food in separate plates. I served it to everyone. We ate our food very quickly as we were all hungry.The food was delicious. We started playing cards after lunch. It was around 4 pm when we decided to leave. We packed our things and left. It was a fun day for all of us.Today morning at 7 o'clock I entered into my office. My office is totally 6 floors. 6th floor is in my control, like cleaning, floor maintenance and everything. So I start up my first duty, cleaning. I love that, because each and everyone wants cleanliness. According to everyday health, cleanliness and hygiene are essential to maintaining good health. Also it avoids bacteria and viruses that cause illness. Now I prepare to clean my floor. For that I have cleaning equipment in my store room.First I open the store room. From there I will collect my cleaning equipments. First I will take the vacuum cleaner. By using the vacuum cleaner, I clean the yesterday dust and dirt. After that I will take one bucket of water. In that water I will mix "antibacterial surface cleaner".Then by using a mop I will clean the floor as well. After the cleaning my floor was looking good and hygienic. Now I arrange the tables and computers properly. My first duty is over with my satisfaction.I decided to make a split pea soup for dinner, so I cleaned off a cutting board, wiped down the table, and got all of my needed ingredients ready.  I grabbed several stalks of celery and a carrot, washed them, and peeled the carrot with a peeler.  Then, I placed the carrot on the cutting board and sliced it lengthwise.  After splitting the carrot, I proceeded to use my knife to chop the two sides into small half circles.  Following this, I washed off the several stalks of celery I picked out, and chopped off the ends, throwing them away.  I then sliced each stalk of celery lengthwise, before chopping them into smaller pieces.  Finally, I picked a large potato, washed all the dirt off of it, and peeled it.  I used the large knife to cut it lengthwise and then chop it into bite sized pieces for use in the soup.My family had gone on vacation.  We hadn't all been together in a couple of years and we decided that we needed to take a photo together.  We had traveled to the beach and we thought the beach would make a wonderful backdrop for our picture.  We told everyone what time we wanted to take the picture and walked down to meet at the beach.  Everyone showed up, but there was still a problem.  Who was going to take the picture?  Luckily, there was an older couple on the beach who came up to us.  They offered to take the photo while we posed.  We were so grateful.  They snapped a few pictures and gave the camera back to us.  We talked to them for a while and expressed our gratitude.  After that, we went to a local photo shop to develop our pictures.  They came out better than we thought!One morning, I got up and I was very tired. I decided to make a cup of coffee to wake myself up. Reaching in the fridge, I pulled out the coffee, placed a filter in the coffee maker and added the water to the machine. While the coffee maker made the coffee, I decided to pour myself a bowl of cereal. As I ate, the aroma of the coffee filled the kitchen with a rich, earthy smell, letting me know that my hot drink was ready. I quickly went to cabinet, pulled out my favorite mug, and filled it with coffee and just a little bit of creamer and sugar. After finishing my first cup of coffee, I poured a second cup into a thermos that I could take with me to work, and finished getting ready for the day. After a little jolt of caffeine, I was ready to take on anything the day might throw at me!This past month, I was very busy with planning a party for my younger brother. I had to find out a number of things, but the most important one was figuring out who I could invite to the party. After I had a good enough idea, I went to the store and bought several themed party invitations. After buying the invitations, I spent a long time writing names and addresses for people that I wanted to invite to the party. After finishing the writing and putting all of the invitations in envelopes, I put stamps on them so they could all be mailed out as soon as possible. I made sure that all of the invitations had stamps and the correct addresses of the people who would be getting them, and put them in my mailbox for the postman to take them to the post office to be sent off. On the day of the party, almost everyone I sent an invitation to came to the party, and that made my brother very happy.I always wash the dishes for my family, I think it a fairly fun chore, and I like it much better than other chores. One night, after a large family dinner, we had a lot of dishes to do. After I started washing them, I put them on the counter to dry. Because there were so many of them, I ran out of room and had to stack them one on top of the other. Well, I stacked them so high that they kept falling over. Thankfully, none of them were made of glass. But, it was really funny because no matter how hard I tried, I could not get them to stack right. Finally, I had to stop washing the dishes and start drying them so I could make room for more clean dishes. I would wash a batch, then dry them, and then wash the next batch. It took me almost a half hour to finish them!When I looked out my front window, I saw a man I did not know yelling at a woman who lives next door. He looked very scary. I didn't want to go out there because he looked scary, but I wanted to help my neighbor. So I called 911. A nice woman on the phone said, "What is the nature of your emergency?" I told her. She asked me where I lived, and I told her. Then she asked me if it looked like the man had a weapon. I said I didn't think so. She told me not to worry, but to stay inside. Then she told me the police were on the way. She talked to me until they arrived. She wanted to know how old I was, and where I went to school. She also asked me about how things were going outside. He was still yelling. But soon the police came, and took him away. I felt better.Last night, my pants ripped and I felt the need to sew them. The seam was ripped and the button fell of and I couldn't find it. I then had to go to the store and get a button that looked like it would fit. Then, I went and found my sewing machine and used it to sew the button onto the pants. I turned this machine on attached it to the pants and began to sew. I noticed that the pants slowly begun to get fixed. Upon finishing, I turned off the machine and checked to make sure that my pants were completely fixed. I noticed that they were and tried them on. Once I tried them on, I realized that they were indeed fixed and I felt good that they were back to working. I then wore them and walked around and put away the sewing machine for the day.One day I was strolling in the woods with my camera. It was a nice high quality camera with a zoom lens. The camera was beautiful, but the photographs it took were even more beautiful. Anyway, I was strolling through the woods. I had my camera, and I pictured a good shot. I then took my camera out and aimed it. I aimed well, and I captured the best photograph that anyone has ever taken. Or at least, in my opinion anyways. Well, back to the photograph. It was taken of a scene in the woods, one of those dark, forested scenes that makes you dread your own existence. It was of a large tree, next to another tree, next to another tree, in the forest. There was a beam of light casting through the frame. It was exhilarating. I can still see the photo now, burning a hole in my mind's eye. What a day.I just got out of bed and am having a very hard time focusing.  I feel like I can barely function.  Then it hits me, I am in desperate need of caffein.  I walk into the kitchen.  I open the cabinet and take out a can of coffee.  It is a new can so I have to open with the can opener.  I line the basket with a disposable paper liner for easier clean up.  Next I get a spoon out of the drawer and measure out a large scoop of coffee and add to the filter basket.  Just the smell is helping me to wake up.  I measure out two more scoops of coffee. I then put the filter into the coffee maker. I then take the carafe and fill with water.  This is then poured into the coffee pot.  I hit the on button and wait a couple of minutes.  Then I pour the hot coffee into a mug and start to feel better.One of my lights in my lamp went out yesterday so I investigated to see what was the matter.  I checked and the lamp was plugged and circuit breaker not tripped so I checked the bulb in the lamp.  Further inspection revealed the bulb was brown so I knew it had burned out and needed replacement.  Not having any extra in the house, I decided to go to the local Home Depot to buy the bulb I need.  I checked the store and looked at the wide variety of available bulbs to purchase.  I finally settled on a 75 Watt equal LED bulb and went to the counter to make my purchase.  The clerk was friendly on check out and I got the five dollars from my wallet to buy the home.  I then drove home and returned to my house.  I found the lamp in my living room and unscrewed the old bulb in the lamp after making sure the lamp was turned off.  I then screwed in the new light bulb, flipped the power switch, and the light came on.  Voila!After taking a two week trip to Europe I arrived home with lots of laundry.  I decided that I should start washing my clothes the night I arrived home.  I did three loads of laundry but I was so tired that I tossed all of the clothes onto the couch without folding them.  I woke the next morning feeling a bit refreshed and decided that is was time to tackle the pile of clothing on the couch.  First I separated the clothes into heaps based on clothing type and then I began folding all of the items.  I used to work in a clothing store so I began folding my clothes very precisely.  I folded everything neatly and made piles based on how the clothes would be stores in my closet.  Once all of the clothes were folded I returned them all to their proper places in my closet and I was ready to start my day.Yesterday I decided to boil some milk so I could make cottage cheese. The first thing I did was select a pan to boil the milk. I decided to choose the widest pan I had, because the wider pan would let me boil the milk more quickly. It is important to select the right pan, a narrow pan will take longer for the milk to come to a boil and will increase the risk of burning the milk on the bottom of the pan. Once I selected the pan, I poured the milk into the pan, and turned the heat on the stove top to medium high heat. For the next ten minutes, I constantly stirred the milk as it heated, to evenly distribute heat and to reduce the risk of the milk burning in the pan. After ten minutes of heating, the milk came to a boil, so I removed the pan from the heat, ready to use my sterilized milk to make cottage cheese.I get out of the shower all refreshed, and head out to the kitchen in my robe. I take out the eggs, bacon and butter. I put sliced bagel in the toaster, I forgot to takeout my cream cheese. I need to go get that. I love the garlic chive cream cheese on my onion bagels. It's the perfect combo. I crack my eggs into a bowl and whisk it up to make some scrambled eggs. But I need to cook the bacon first. I cook the bacon in butter until golden brown and crispy. My pan is full of oil and butter. I am going to scramble my eggs in that. It will be deliciously decadent. I scramble my eggs in rendered fat and butter mix until they're almost done. Then I put the eggs and the bacon on the plate. along with the bagel with cream cheese slathered all over it. It's time to eat. I need a dollop of pico de gallo for my eggs. Perfect.It was Beth's birthday part coming up next week, and Beth and her mom sat down at the table to write invitations to all her friends.  She had twenty to write, so that is why they both were doing it together.  Beth had a pile in front of her, pretty cards, and a big ink pen to write with. She started , and the first thing she did was put her name, the time of the party, and where the party was, on each card.  Then she wrote, " Please come! Love, Beth" on each one.   Her mother then put them all in envelopes and stuck a stamp on the envelopes.  Lastly, she wrote out the addresses on all the invitations.  Beth helped her mother gather the envelopes together, and they drove to the post office to mail them. Beth was excited when they were all mailed, and thanked her mother for helping her with the party invitations.My friends and I love to go to the movie theater.  Every Tuesday, the movie theaters have cheap days, where you can go see a movie for $5, and then buy a drink and small snack for $5 too. So, we check online to see when the movies are playing, and we decide what we will see.  Then, once we do that, we all go in the car and drive to the theater right before the movie begins.  We park, and get out and stand in line for the tickets.  We usually all buy our own tickets, and then go in and order a drink and snack.  After that, we all go into the theater, and take our seats.  The movie always has previews before the real movie begins, so we have time to talk a little before the movie starts.  It also gives you time, if you were running late, to get there so you don't miss the movie.  We have a great time.I needed to put wall paper on the walls of my room. The room was in dire need of new wall paper. The old wall paper was looking bad. I asked my friend Ryan to help me put new wall paper up. He was a painter and regularly did this kind of work. I first removed the old wall paper from the walls with Ryan. We then got the new wall paper and applied it to the walls. It required us to brush down the paper so it would stick. We checked to make sure everything was even. I did not want uneven wall paper. After we applied the first sheet we started applying the other ones. We checked to make sure the sheets were even as we went. Finally after applying the new sheets we cut the excess paper away. I wanted my room to look tidy and fresh. Overall it was fun putting up new wall paper with my friend.I emptied out the little bit of coffee that was still in the pot from yesterday and rinsed the pot out. I turned on my water filter and started filling the pot to the line that shows "6". I dumped the water into the water reservoir of the coffee maker. I carefully removed the filter with the used coffee grounds from the day before out of the coffee maker and threw it in the trash can. I got a new filter out of the bag that I keep in a cupboard above the coffee maker and put it into the basket. I measured six tablespoons of coffee into the filter and closed the basket. I turned the coffee maker on and waited for it to brew. When the coffee was brewed I poured some into a mug, added a few spoonfuls of sugar and some creamer which I stirred and was ready to drink.It was a sad day.  June's great Aunt Martha had died a few days ago, and today was the day they would have her funeral.  Everyone in her family was dressed nicely, and made there way across town to the funeral home where the service would be held.  As the entered the room, there was a strong smell of flowers that made June's nose ache a little.  Her mom signed a book with her and her brothers names, and they made there way into a parlor where other people had gathered.  At the front of the room was a casket that was half way opened with Aunt Martha's body lying in it. The family made there way up to the front of the room to look at Aunt Martha. She looked as if she was taking a nap in her finest clothes.  Her make up and hair didn't really look like she used to wear them, but she didn't look scary like June had imagined.  They met some family members that were sad and crying, but others were laughing and remembering funny stories about Aunt Martha.  They made there way to a seat at the back of the parlor and a few songs were played while the curtains were drawn in the front  of the room.  When the curtains opened back up, the casket was closed with a large spray of flowers on top.  A pastor stood up and said some really nice things about Aunt Martha, and prayed.  The curtains closed again and the pastor told the crowd that the funeral would resume at Shady Oak Cemetery.  Afterwards, the group of people that had gathered made there ways to their car for the funeral procession to the cemetery.  June's family followed a long line of cars following a hearse with Aunt Martha's casket in the back.  A police man escorted the group of cars, and stopped traffic so the funeral procession didn't have to stop at red lights on the way to the cemetery.  As they pulled up to the gravesite, June saw a green tent with lots of folding chairs underneath, and a metal frame around a hole in the ground.  The family gathered around the tent as the pallbearers carried Aunt Martha's casket to the gravesite and placed it on the frame over the hole.  The pastor said a few brief words and prayer again, and then Aunt Martha's casket was lowered into the ground.  The family talked a little while, and then drove over to Aunt Martha's house to have a wake.  There they ate food prepared by a local church for the family, and talked about the good times they had with Aunt Martha when she was alive.I'm hungry and I think I want some scrambled eggs. I need to get my ingredients first. I open the refrigerator and grab two eggs, butter, and the milk. I get my non-stick pan from the cabinet and a silicone spatula. I place a little butter in the pan and turn the stove on medium heat. As the pan begins to heat, I crack my eggs, add a little milk and mix thoroughly. I think my pan is ready and pour my eggs in while moving them slowly with the spatula. I sprinkle them lightly with salt and pepper and continue stirring. As they start to firm up in areas, I lower the heat and continue stirring just long enough until my eggs look slightly set. I don't like them too runny. I can now slide them off onto my plate and turn off the stove. I have a nutritious meal in minutes.My mom is teaching me to drive. First thing, we check to make sure the blinkers are working. I flipped the lever on the left side of the steering column up for the right blinker and down for the left. Both arrows under the speedometer blinked and on the outside of the car in the front and back. Next we got in and fastened our seat belts, then I checked the side mirrors and rear view to make sure I could see. I inserted the keys into the ignition and using my thumb and first finger pushed the switch forward. I checked the mirrors again to make sure all people, animals, and objects where out of the way. I pulled the gear shift towards me and pulled down one click going from P (park) to R (reverse). I check the mirrors once more and turned my head to the right to look over my shoulder to back out of the driveway. At the end of the driveway, I pushed the turn signal lever down to signal I was turning left. I looked to the right and to the left to check for traffic twice and pulled out.One day I was super hungry and craving a delicious cheese, spinach, and tomato pizza! I decide to alleviate my hunger and my craving by ordering a pizza from Domino's. I called Domino's to leave my order, and told them exactly what I wanted in a size medium. I did not order anything else when they asked me if I would like anything in addition! They then asked me if I would like delivery or pick up. I wanted to spend the evening relaxing after a long day and just watch movies with my pizza, so I opted for delivery. Twenty minutes later the delivery man arrived at my door with my pizza. I pull out my debit card and swiped it, because that was my preferred method of payment. I then had to sign for using my debt card, and also made sure I filled in the empty line that said tip bedside it. I made sure to leave the delivery man a generous one since he was here in a timely manner and was quite polite in dealing with me. After he proceeded back to his car,  I sat down on the couch and ate my pizza while watching one of my favorite movies. It was a successful evening and the pizza was scrumptious!Last night I invited some friends over for dinner. I decided to set the dining room table for dinner, rather than have us all eat around the coffee table in the living room like my partner and I usually do. First, I chose the tablecloth. We have a purple tablecloth, a light blue snowflake patterned tablecloth, and a bright colored floral tablecloth. I chose the floral one because I felt it was most appropriate for summertime. Next, I put a cloth napkin at each place and set utensils on top of the napkin - a knife, fork, and spoon. Then I placed a plate at each setting, four in total. I added a water glass at each setting as well. Then I put out the salt and pepper in the middle of the table so it was accessible to everyone. Lastly, I lit two candles and placed them in the center of the table as well. The dining room table looked great and ready for a dinner party.It was a long day at work and I decided to stop at the gym before going home.  I ran on the treadmill and lifted some weights. I decided I would also swim a few laps in the pool.  Once I was done working out, I went in the locker room and stripped down and wrapped myself in a towel.  I went into the sauna and turned on the heat.  I let it get nice and steamy. I sat down and relaxed.  I let my mind think about nothing but peaceful, happy thoughts.  I stayed in there for only about ten minutes because it was so hot and steamy.  When I got out, I turned the sauna off to save energy and took a cool shower.  I got out of the shower and dried off.  After that, I put on my extra set of clean clothes I brought with me, and got in my car and drove home.I had a first date recently and I wanted to cook for her. I was low on money and sometimes cooking a meal yourself is more thoughtful and romantic. I had it all planned out. I was going to light candles and get us some wine for our intimate dinner. I was planning on making a chicken alfredo. First, I started boiling the water to cook the pasta. In another pan, I add some olive oil and starting cooking some broccoli and some chicken. I had plenty of garlic and spices. That is how I like it. After the pasta is cooked, I add it to the other pan with the chicken and broccoli. I add in the alfredo sauce and stir it. After about two minutes, the meal is nice and hot and ready to enjoy. She loved the meal and we had a great time together that night.Today was a really hot day. It was 95 degrees. I decided to go to the swimming pool in my neighborhood and cool off. I put on my bathing suit, a cover up dress, a hat with a large brim, sunglasses, and flip flops. I packed a bag with sunscreen, a towel, and a cold bottle of water. Then I walked three blocks to the swimming pool. It was crowded, but I was able to find an available lounge chair on the side of the pool. I put my things down and took the sunscreen out of the bag. I prayed the sunscreen all over my body. Then I laid down on the chair to relax. After about twenty minutes, I was ready to go in the water and go swimming. I swam five laps and then I was ready to get out. I got out of the pool, toweled off, and laid down on the chair again. It was a nice day.Last weekend, my friend and I decided it would be a good time to paper our living room. The previous residents of the house we live in had used wallpaper on the living room walls that was a very odd shade of red, which we thought looked strange. We wanted the living room to get a new color of wallpaper, and we wanted to choose a color that would match our personality. We first went to Sherwin-Williams, which is a paint and wallpaper store. We looked at the wallpaper color samples and picked up a few brochures with examples of how the samples would look on our walls. We decided that a cheery yellow color would look best on our walls, and selected that color. We then returned to Sherwin-Williams and purchased the yellow wallpaper. We then applied the wallpaper to our walls and stood back to admire our work.I'm in charge of preparing the picnic as we head to the lake. I have a lot of supplies I need to gather first. I need to fold up the waterproof tarp for the ground or picnic tables. I need a blanket that can double as a tablecloth. I'll be sure to pack that on top so we pull it out first. I need to pack forks, spoons, knives, napkins, cups, paper towels, a couple of garbage bags and few zip top backs for leftovers. I'll make a shooter sandwich with meat and cheese. Since it's smashed, it will travel well and it can be cut up in advance. I'll also pack the potato salad in a container, some chips, and pretzels. Maybe some Boursin dip for both. I will also pack some pre-made sangria and lemon water in spill-proof bottles. I think chocolate chip cookies are great picnics too. They can go in a container so they don't get crushed. We should have all we need.We have a large yard, a half acre on a corner lot. Due to the size, we have a ride-on mower which makes cutting the grass relatively easy, I would even say "fun." Thanks to a lot of experience, I can get that thing moving and get the yard done in just a little under an hour. It's normal, average, boring. Except this one time.... A cousin had taken our ride-on mower to do some maintenance on it. He had taken it on a Friday evening and had promised it would be back by Sunday evening. He was wrong. Sunday and Monday came and went with no sign of our lawn mower. Tuesday evening came and the grass was up to your ankles. It needed to be cut. We had bought a small push mower to get into the small spaces so we pulled it out. Me, my wife and my mother-in-law took turns pushing that mower up and down the yard for a good two hours. We had one tiny little bit left of the yard when Howard, the cousin, pulled up with the push mower.When you work in a restaurant, after the customers have paid the bill and left, you have to clean up the table and prepare it for the next customer.  Sometimes it can be very easy if it was only one person, but if it was a large family it could be very messy.  All the left over plates, cups and utensils need to be cleared away to the kitchen to be washed.  The table top will also need to be wiped down of any food or spills, so it is fresh and clean for the next diners.   And if there are placemats they too will need replacing.  My favorite placemats are the ones you can color in, especially when they leave crayons on the table for you to use.  Once the new place mats are down, a whole new table setting can be done.  Often restaurants and cafes will have a special way they like their tables to be set up and its up to the wait staff to make sure that its done that way for every table.  It may involve fancy folded napkins, or how the glasses or utensils get lined up. Some times it involves a whole new setting of plates, utensils and glasses and other times the table is bare except for the salt and pepper shakers.  But regardless of what the restaurants table set up may look like, the table has to be ready so new customers can come in and enjoy their meal.My name is Katie and I am a professional photographer.  My seven year old daughter Penny also takes pictures with her camera. When Penny was five she asked me to show her how to take photos. She needed her own small camera so she can learn. We went to the store and bought Penny her first camera. We then went to the dog park. Penny loves dogs and wanted to photograph them. We arrived at the park and sat down on a bench so I can teach her how to use her camera. She opened the box and got her camera out. Penny pressed the big red button and the camera cut on. I showed her how to hold the camera correctly and how to take her first photo. Since then, Penny has learned how to take beautiful photographs. She is planning to teach other children how to take photos.It has been raining a lot and the lawn has been growing. So I mowed the lawn this morning. I had to go to the gas station to get some more gas to put into the lawn mower. Fortunately my lawn is small. But to me it is a hassle to have to mow it. Sometimes I mow it once a week. Anyhow, I put the gas into the mower, but it would not start. I think it needed some more oil. I but a bit of oil in and it started right up. I mowed in rows as I usually do. There were several sticks on the ground I had to pick up. I don't like mowing over sticks. There was a turtle hiding in the bushes while I was mowing. I had to lock my dog inside the house. My dog would chase the lawn mower if I didn't.It is an exciting time when going to the movie theater. My mom takes me and my siblings every summer. The theater is about 30 minutes away from our house. My mom always buys tickets ahead of time to make sure we have tickets since the theater is a little distance away. Once we are at the theater we pick up our pre ordered tickets. We then head to the snack line. While waiting in the line we all decide what snacks we want. I love to get popcorn with lots of butter, a pickle and a large Dr. Pepper. After we get our snacks we head to the theater to watch the movie. Once inside, we pick out what seats we would like. We don't want to be too close or too far, the middle is the perfect spot. Once we get settled the movie starts. Everyone is quietly watching the movie until it is over. Then we all drive back home.I enjoy drinking tea.  I made tea just this morning as a pleasant start to my day.  I filled my kettle up with water and put it on the stove.  I turned the heat all the way up so that the water would get hot quickly.  When the kettle started to whistle, that let me know the water was hot.  I poured the water into a mug, being very careful not to burn myself.  I scooped out some tea leaves into a little tea infuser, which I put in my mug.  After several minutes, I felt like the tea was probably strong enough to start drinking.  I like to add a little honey to my tea to make it sweet.  After I finished my cup of tea, there was enough hot water to make more! I poured water into a thermos, added more tea to the tea infuser, and sealed it up tight so that I'd have some nice strong tea ready to drink when I got to work.Last night my air conditioner stopped working. It was so hot and sweaty while I was sleeping. It was clear when I woke up that I was going to have to change my sheets! I took off the blankets, sheets and pillow cases. I took them all to the laundry room. I placed the into the washing machine. I added the proper amount of liquid laundry detergent. I like the stuff that has a really strong smell. I closed the lid and let it wash. After it was done, I removed them and placed the in the dryer with a fabric softener sheet. They took an hour to dry. I removed them while they were still warm and carried them to my room. I placed the fitted sheet on, as the corners played a game of popping off as I ran from corner to corner putting it back on. I then put the flat sheet on, the blankets on the pillow cases on and top a moment to lay on top of the fresh bedding and just smell it for a minute. That is the best smell in the world.I always wash my hair at the beginning of my shower. I make the water hot and stand under the hot water to make my hair wet. I switch between different shampoo and conditioner brands so grab whichever scent I want to smell that day. I squeeze a big glob of shampoo in my hand and rub my hands together then lather it into my hair, I rinse the shampoo out. I squeeze the matching conditioner into my hand and start at my roots rubbing it up to my scalp. Once I get all of the conditioner distributed I let it sit for a few minutes to do it's job, I wash the rest of my body while the conditioner is working. I rinse out all of the conditioner and turn the water off. I gently put my hair up in a towel to dry it and when it is towel dry I run leave in conditioner through it to make it more manageable.My dog justice is begging me to walk her. I get up and put her leash on. She starts wagging her tail. Justice also started to scratch the door. We proceed out the door. The sun is shining. We walk up the street to the park. I also had to remember to bring her water and bowl. I brought her ball to play catch. We stop and play fetch. Justice loves playing fetch. I also brought a bag in case she poops. After the park we head to the lake. We sit at the lake and she goes swimming. We swim for a little bit. We begin our journey back home. She is wet and she doesn't care. She dries off while we are walking. I let her smell the flowers. She goes poop on someone's lawn. I pick it up with my pooper scooper. We go home and relaxEvery week I go to the store to stock up on groceries for my family.  First, I make a plan for the meals I want to make during the week.  Then, I look through the cupboards and refrigerator and freezer to see what I already have.  If I need something to make a meal and I don't have it already on hand, I put it on my list.  After I do this, I then check my pantry for staples.  I like to always have certain things on hand like ketchup or vegetable oil.  I also check to make sure we don't need any paper products like toilet paper or paper towel.  If I find anything that we need, it goes on the list.  Once my list is complete, I get in the car and drive to the store.  I make sure to mark off each item as I put it in the cart so I don't miss anything.I went to the Dallas Museum of Art yesterday. It was so much fun. I took my friend Becky. She loves art. When we got there we bought our tickets. I liked the big entrance with all types of art all around. First we went to the painting area. There were many paintings. We could have spent the whole day looking at all the paintings and talking about them. One painting had a lady in front of a house. It looked simple, but my friend Becky explained the painting to me. The painting had meanings or symbolism in it. She said it was like a story looking at the lady's facial expression and how her house looked. Next we went to look at the sculptures. There were very old ones and some modern ones as well. I think I liked the paintings better. I liked the colors of the painting.The phone rang and I went over to it and I picked up the receiver and said "Hello."  "who is calling please?"  It was gramma and I talked with her for a period of time about my day and she told me about hers and what she had been dong and how grandpa was.  She calling to speak with my mother but she was not home at the time.  Gramma asked if I had a pencil and paper and could take a message for mom and give it to her when she cane home.  I said I would do the best I could to do so.  I got a pencil and paper and slowly wrote down what gramma told me, and she had me read it back to her to make sure I got the information right.  I did and I said "goodbye" to gramma and she said "goodbye" to me.This morning I woke to find I needed to do laundry. The first thing I did was divide my clothes in to piles, based on how I would wash them. The light clothes were in one pile. Dark and heavy clothes were in another. The white clothes, that I would also add bleach to, were in a third. The clothes I could not wash, that needed to be dry cleaned were put aside. I loaded the first set of clothes in to the washer, the white. I picked up the bottle of laundry soap and filled the cap up all the way. I poured the cap over the clothes in the washer. I poured a bit of bleach in as well, to make sure all the stains came out. Once they were ready, I turned the dial on the machine. I made sure it was washing on warm and the dial read "whites". I waited for them to finish and put the in the dryer. Once I had I did the same thing over again, only not using bleach, for the other piles of clothes.It is chaos when these kids are playing. I let them do it on one condition that they will clean up after they play, but they had to go for appointment, so today was my turn to so it. First of all I made sure that everything is else is taken care of except toys. So I picked up any clothes were lying around. Then, i picked up all the books and put it on shelf. Grabbed the toy box and put the toys in which supposed to go in. There are some big dolls which I put it bu the closet. There is riding horse that I moved it to the corner. Some trucks and cars where there which are kind of big, I arranged them on shelf. There were so many crayons were lying around so I put them all in plastic bag. The doll house furniture was misplaced so I put them back on its place and I was done.Our poor Baby saw the Doctor and she had a ear infection. The Doctor gave her some medicine to take for 10 days, to make her feel better. She likes bubblegum flavored so we had it made to taste just like bubblegum. We loaded her medicine dropper to the amount she needed. When she saw me with the dropper she curled her lips and started crying. I showed her I liked the medicine and that it was tasted really yummy. Then I pretended it was a truck and it drove right into her mouth. She looked puzzled at first then she smiled and reached for more. I laughed at her and said no you will need to wait until it is time for you to take it again. Now when she sees the dropped with her medicine she smiles at me and claps. She enjoys the train dropping her medicine of in her mouth every day.When my girlfriend and I decided to take a vacation to Florida and we knew we needed to make flight reservations.  We went online and looked at our favorite airline to see what flights they had to Florida the day we wanted to leave and a flight the day wanted to come home.  We found flights we wanted and set to making our reservation.  We made sure the flights we liked had two seats available, and we got to choose where on the airplane we got to sit.  We choose two seats together in row 10, a window seat and a middle.  While the middle seat isn't as much fun as the window it meant we could sit together.  Now that we had our seats, for the way there, we then picked out seats for the way home and we were able to pick the same ones.  Now with both flights selected, we went to the payment page and paid for the seats with a credit card.  With the flights paid for, we could print out our tickets for our trip to Florida.I went out to eat at a restaurant last weekend with my husband. We went to a place that is pretty popular in town and has gotten really good reviews. We had to wait a few minutes for a table, but soon enough we were seated. The restaurant had a warm and friendly feel, and our waiter appeared right after we were seated. She was warm and friendly too. She greeted us and asked for our drink orders. My husband just wanted water, but I got an unsweet tea with lemon. We chose not to order an appetizer, but the waitress brought our drinks and a basket of rolls for us to snack on. We ordered our entrees then, having had time to study the menu. My husband got a steak and baked potato with a side of steamed broccoli and I ordered the salmon and wild rice. Our waitress took the order, then promised to have our food out soon. We sampled the bread while she was gone. The rolls were delicious and the tea was refreshing. My husband and I began talking about how our days had been and discussing moving, which we are in the middle of currently. We talked for a few minutes until our food arrived, then settled down to eat. I had only taken a bite of my fish, however, when I realized that something was wrong. The smell was off and it had a bad taste. I thought it must be bad. I waited until our waitress was coming back by, then I asked her if she would take it back and bring me something different, because I felt like the salmon was going bad. She agreed and I ordered a steak like my husband got. He said his was delicious. The waitress took the fish and apologized profusely. She brought my steak out very shortly and it was fantastic. She kept checking on us throughout the meal, and the manager even came over to offer us a free dessert. He apologized for the salmon and said that the cook had made a mistake and pulled from the stock that was about to be thrown away. We accepted the free dessert, New York-style cheesecake. It was so creamy and sweet. We enjoyed our meal, overall. Our waitress brought us out ticket and even marked down our meal. We tipped generously and left satisfied.Going to the dentist was hard for Mike. He was a little bit afraid of going, but his mom always went with him.  When he got to the dentist office, they were all nice to him.  He had to go sit in a dentist chair, and lean back for the lady to check his teeth.  Then she started to clean his teeth with a little machine and a little stick.  The machine made a whirring sound , but it was just water in it, and it washed his mouth out when she finished.  She then rubbed his teeth with a buffer, that made his teeth shine.  It tasted like bubble gum. He liked that part.  Then the dentist came in and examined his mouth, to make sure the lady cleaned them well. He was also checking for cavities.  Mike had no cavities that day, and the dentist was happy with Mike's clean mouth. He gave Mike a bag of things to take home, a new toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss.I always want to cook and finally I did it last night. I chose to have an egg-drop soup since it should be easy to do and great to taste. I prepared all ingredients: two scrambled eggs on a bowl, one teaspoon of corn starch mixed with water, a handful of chopped green onion, one teaspoon of sesame oil, a half teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of soy sauce. I placed them in sequence of cooking order so I could just keep pouring them into the pot without messing up orders. Darn, I missed the most important item - boiling water. With water started boiling in the pot, I began putting ingredients in as plan. The soup finished good, but still seemed to be missing something. Oh, it was the white pepper power and black vinegar. It was not too late to add them in. With the final touch, it tasted much better. That was not too bad for my first soup.If there‚Äôs one cleaning task I used to put off the most, it was definitely cleaning the shower. I mixed up a batch of the homemade shower cleaner and sprayed it liberally my bathroom shower, which needed some serious help at the time. The homemade shower cleaner consist of  a spray bottle, 1 cup of dawn dishwasher liquid and 1 cup of vinegar and regular water. After I sprayed my homemade solution around the shower I let it sit for around an hour. After an hour, I grabbed a scrubbing brush and began to scrub away all the mildew stains that were in the shower. I find it best that you have the bathroom well-ventilated when you start scrubbing because you don't want to inhale all those nasty chemicals when your scrubbing away at your shower. After I finished scrubbing away all the shower gunk I turned on the shower and let all the dirty water and cleaning agents flow into the shower drain.I decided to go camping tomorrow night.  To prepare, we needed to get some supplies.  We took our sleeping bags from the closet, and put them in the trunk of the car.  We packed a bag with food; snacks like pretzels, canned beans and corn, sandwiches, fruit and some water.   We carried blankets, flashlights, hats and gloves to the car, and packed a separate bag with clothes and extra shoes.  We made sure that we had a map that would direct us to the campsite, and extra batteries for our flashlights.  We were only staying one night, but had to make sure we were prepared for cold weather and had enough food.  When the car was packed, we went to the gas station to put extra gas in our car to make sure we would have enough to get to and from the campsite the next day.  We would sleep that night, and tomorrow morning would pack our pillows, tooth brushes and toothpaste, get dressed and get in the car to drive to the campsite.Billy decided he wanted to hang his new painting of a locomotive in his bedroom, he had the perfect spot picked, right above the cat tree in the corner of his bedroom. He held the picture up to the wall finding the perfect spot and marked the center of it with a pencil so he knew where the nail should go. Billy then went to his hallway closet where he had a small dresser where he kept his tools and he picked up a hammer, a nail, and a level. Billy then gently tapped the nail into the wall with the nail angled upwards a little to help hold the picture in place with his hammer being careful not to tap the nail in to the wall too far as it would‚Äôve been hard for him to pull out. He then hung the picture on the nail and used the level on the bottom of the picture so he could make sure the picture was straight on the wall. Billy then stood back and admired his new painting of a locomotive he‚Äôs wanted for a long time.My wife had a stressful week at work and the weekend had finally come. I knew she needed to relax and feel pampered, so I arranged for us to visit the local sauna. I surprised her with the news and she seemed very happy. We both put on some comfortable clothing and headed to our relaxing retreat. When we got there the attendant took our information and asked what services we would be needing. I arranged for massages for both of us and we were given locker keys and robes. We parted ways to go into the appropriate locker rooms and change into our robes and the swimwear we brought along. After changing we had our massages, relaxing all parts of our bodies. Then we both went into a private sauna room and closed the wooden door. There was a pot of hot coals in the middle of the room and we had been instructed how to use it. I took a ladle of water from the pedestal  in the corner and poured it on the hot coals. Steam poured out of the coals and filled the warm room. Soon the sauna was filled with warm soothing steam and we both laid down together on the benches and took in the sensations. We became extremely relaxed and had forgotten about the stresses of work. Afterwards, we both changed back into our clothing and headed home for a stress-free weekend.An unfortunate truth of life is that some day we all die. Sadly, I lost my grandmother a couple weeks ago. She was in poor health for the past eight years due to a stroke, and a second major stroke several weeks prior to her death left her completely incapacitated. It was a long distance to get to Wisconsin, so I flew out from New York the day before the wake. All my family was there, including my aunts, uncles, cousins, and parents. The wake was sad, but my family put together photos and a video from my grandmother's life, and we talked about the good times we remembered. The following morning, we attended the funeral, where my uncle gave a eulogy, the pastor gave a sermon, and we sang some of grandma's favorite hymns. We then drove in a procession, or long line of cars, to the graveyard, where we said our final goodbyes and cried. Funerals are always sad, but we get to reminisce on memories of good times with our departed loved ones.Beth and Tim usually prepare dinner almost every night at their house.  They have two children, and when they get home at night from work, Beth and Tim usually start by getting out the pots and pans to cook with.  They look into their refrigerator, and see what they have to cook that night. Last night they picked out steak, some vegetables, and some bread to make a dinner.  They put all the food onto the counter, and started to wash the vegetables first.  Then they cut up the vegetables to make a salad.  They put the salad to the side, and made sure that they had some salad dressing in the refrigerator, so that they could use that for the salad.  They put salt, pepper and some steak sauce on the steak for seasoning.   Next, they heated up the oven, and put the steaks into the oven on high heat. It didn't take long for the steaks to cook, and then they cut up pieces of bread with butter, and put the food on plates to feed everyone.I had planned a barbecue for all of my friends, and today was the day that it was going to happen.  I got up in the morning to go to the store to get some stuff for the barbecue.  I got in the car and went to the store.  At the store, I went through the aisles and got meat, vegetables , fruits, and so much more.  I went back home to start cooking so I could start the barbecue.  I went outside and started the grill.  I put all of the meat and vegetables on the grill to cook them.  Then all of my friends came.  The food was ready and we started to eat.  We ate the meat and the vegetables. It was really good.  Then we talked and had a lot of fun.  Then everyone left and I cleaned everything up.  Then I went back inside and finished my day.The other day was so crazy! I came home and the kitchen was on fire! I guess Dave left the stove on when he cooked lunch and went back to work and forgot about it. But I could see smoke coming out the door the second I got my key out and it was so warm in the garage. I was freaking out, ran out to the car and got my cell phone. I called 911 as fast as I could. Luckily for us, the fire department is only a mile away and they were there in just 3-4 minutes. Those guys were awesome. They put out the fire so fast and ran in the house without thinking about risking their own lives or limbs. They got it out and only caused a minor amount of damage to the other rooms in the house. The kitchen will need some work but it could have been so much worse. Thank God for those firemen responding quickly after I called 911.I was driving home from work when I noticed that the low fuel light on my dashboard had turned on. I needed to stop for gas otherwise I probably wouldn't make it back to my house. As I was driving, I looked for a gas station. When I found one with good, affordable gas prices, I turned in and pulled up next to a gas pump. I took my wallet out of my purse and got out of my car. I swiped my credit card at the pump and chose the type of fuel that I wanted. I put the gas pump into my car and began fueling. My gas tank was almost empty so it took awhile for my tank to fill up. The gas pump clicked off automatically when my tank was full, and I took the pump out and put it back in its place. I shut my gas cap, took my receipt, and got back in my car to drive home.Tanya loved hanging pictures with her father.  She loved painting things for him.  So, her father decided one day to help her hang some of the paintings.  He helped her pick some of her favorite drawings, and put them in beautiful frames from the store. He had little frames and big frames, and she put in different pictures in each one.  Then her father took a painting in the frame, and a hook, and pushed the hook in the wall.  It screwed in easily, and he made sure that it was against the wall, and then he hung the frame on the hook.  He made sure that the hook was latched onto the frame on the back, and that it was hanging straight.  He hung all her frames up with all her pictures that way.  Her mom was happy to see all her art work in nice frames on the wall.My shower was filthy and grimy. Whoa! All that shower dirt had to go. So what I did was, I went over to my local Walmart, and I bought a sponge, a pair of rubber gloves, any empty five gallon bucket, bleach and shower spray cleaner. I gathered those things and bought them all, and all cost me 9.89 in total, including tax for  these shower cleaning supplies. I headed back home, filled a bucket up with two gallons of hot water, and added two tablespoons of bleach and about a quarter cup of shower cleaner. After that I put on some rubber gloves onto my hands in order to protect them from the harsh chemicals. I then put the sponge deep into the bucket cleaning solution, and then proceeded to scrub my shower with the dousing wet sponge. I rubbed out all of the grime out of the shower with the wet, chemically treated sponge. After I completed the scrub down, it was time to rinse, so I simply ran the shower head with lukewarm water in order to drain all the grime down the shower drain. After that, my shower was finally clean, grime free and looked like new!We made our selection at the steakhouse, slowly sipping our wine to kill the time when the waitress arrived with salads and soon after the entrees. I picked up my knife and began to cut only to realize that the steak was medium. I was so disappointed. I had specifically made the point that I wanted my steak to be rare.  I had a moment's hesitation wondering if I should send it back. I remembered my days working in a restaurant and all things that happen to food that was sent back but in the end,  I decided to be very polite and the waitress if she would indeed take my steak back to kitchen knowing they would have to start over. It would totally kill the timing of our dinner but I had waited so long to come try these steaks that I decided it was worth the risk. A few minutes later my steak arrived and it was perfect.My wife and I decided to have a picnic with my sister and brother-in-law.  We picked out a park to go to because it had a pavilion we could sit under to enjoy the weather.  My wife and I planned to make a salad that had avocado and peppers in it.  My sister said that she would bring pizza and a dessert.  We prepared the salad by cutting up the lettuce and other veggies for the salad.  We put it in a bowl and took it with us as we drove to the park.  We found the place to eat and waited for my sister and brother-in-law to arrive.  After about ten minutes, they showed up with the food and the tablecloth.  We laid out the cloth and put the food on it and the plates.  We ate for the next couple of hours together there.This Morning I was alone in my house. I was at upstairs bedroom. I was reading news paper. Suddenly, I heard a doorbell. I was not sure who it was. I went down the stairs. Then I went towards the door. I looked through the door hole to see who is at the door. It is very important to check who is outside before opening the door. What I saw through the door hole was that It was courier delivery guy. He seemed authentic. So I unlocked the door and rotated the door knob to open the door. The courier guy greeted me, and asked me to sign on a paper before receiving my courier. This is done to make sure the correct person for whom the parcel was intended only gets it. So I signed the paper, took the parcel. The courier guy smiled at me, I said bye to him and then I closed the door and locked it again.The mailman brought the mail up to my door, and I took it from him, and said, "Hello, thank you for bring the mail." He said, "You are most welcome, Ms. Dearling. Have a great day." In the stack of envelopes and news flyers, I found a letter from my sister Autumn. She was writing to me about coming to Indiana for a visit. I quickly went to my desk and pulled out a sheet of paper. Sitting down in my desk chair, I though about my school schedule for the next couple of weeks. There was no reason I would be too busy for her to come and visit the week after my next test. I dug around in the drawer for a pen, but didn't find one. There's always one in the kitchen by the phone, I thought to myself. I quickly ran in and grabbed it. Sitting back down, I wrote, "Dear Autumn," at the top of the page. Telling her to come visit and the dates she could choose from, I quickly put the folded letter in an envelope, addressed it, and put a stamp on the front. I put it in the mailbox and put the little red flag up. That way the mailman would know there was a letter in there for him to pick up the next day. I was happy my sister was coming to visit soon!I was thirsty so I decided to make a cup of tea. I looked through my box of teas and rifled through the assorted flavors. I settled on Earl Gray, which is a black tea flavored with bergamot orange. I filled the kettle with water and placed it on the stove, turning on the burner so that it would heat up and begin boiling. In the meantime, I got out a teacup and saucer, and then removed the teabag from the package and placed it into the empty cup. After a time, the water on the stove began boiling, so I removed it from the stove top and poured a cup-size amount into the teacup. It filled the cup, covering the teabag, soaking it. I removed a spoon from the drawer and placed it in the cup, stirring gently as the contents of the teabag were released and began to color the water a light brown. After some more stirring, the teabag's contents were entirely released and the tea was ready to drink.Last year, when  I threw a party for my girlfriends birthday, I prepared a nice party with family and friends both excited. My first task was finding a day that would work and trying to be discrete about it. This was difficult because we are both busy and also because I had to alert both of our friends to invite while making sure that none of them gave away the secret. I also had to figure out how I was going to get my girlfriend to the party without telling her that we were having a party for her. After establishing all of these details, I planned the party and sent invites, planned the food, and planned some gifts. This experience was good, but was somewhat difficult . As a the party went on, my girlfriend enjoyed it and appreciated my effort. It was fun and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.We opened up the dishwasher. It was filled with dishes that had been cleaned. We took out a few dishes and checked to see if they were clean and dry. The dishes were clean and reflected the light that shone on them. Some of the dishes were not completely dry. We used a clean dish cloth to dry the still somewhat wet dishes by dabbing and gently rubbing the spots of water. We hung the dish cloth back up to let it dry. We took the dishes out one by one. We were careful not to have them clang together too loudly and did not want to accidentally break anything. We set the dishes on the counter, trying to create patterns of large dishes on the bottom and small dishes on the top. We opened the cupboard and placed the largest dishes on the bottom. We placed the smaller dishes on top.Sometimes it becomes big deal to do little things. Same applies for me to change batteries. I have an alarm clock, and needed a battery change. So many times I forgot to get some batteries from store, and once I Had it, forgot where did I put. But finally day came, when I can do it. I got my clock, opened the place to install the batteries with screw driver. The slot was kind of rusted, but worked. Then with help of pointy side of screw driver, I clicked the old batteries out. The one I had them before took them out, now I looked for negative and positive , both on batteries and on place where I had to install them. Because if you do not install them right , it is not going to work right.  I put them in, then adjusted the time on clock, and reset the time for alarm,I really wanted a painting for my hall bathroom. I decided to order a painting of my girls in the bathtub in black and white print. It took a lot of convincing for my husband to hang the painting. He first took out the stud finder and tape measure. He always wants it to be perfect. He found the center of the wall and the stud. He then took out his drill and drilled the screw in the wall. After the screw was in the wall and perfect, I gave him the painting to hang on the wall. Once it was up I made sure it was straight on the wall. I am very happy with the painting that I chose for my bathroom. It just goes perfectly in there and I was very happy my husband decided to hang it for me since he hates hanging pictures in the house!After my kids went to bed tonight, I looked in their playroom and noticed that the had left toys out. I did not want anyone to walk through the room and trip on any of the toys that had been left out. I decided to clean up the toys. I bent down and picked up several stuffed animals and put them back in the toy box. Then I picked up puzzle pieces and put them back in the box they came in. After that, I saw that there were a lot of Legos that were left out of the Lego container. Since they are small and can be hard to see, I sat down on the rug and picked up all of the Lego pieces so I could put them away. The last thing I did was clean up a few Barbie dolls that had not been put away either. Once the playroom was clean, I went to sleep.My little boy was sick, his tummy hurt and he needed medicine to feel better. I went to the medicine cabinet and looked for the stomach medicine. I read the directions and took the bottle into the kitchen. It has a measuring cup on the top, so I took it off and placed it on the counter. I opened the bottle of medicine, then picked the cup up and looked at the measuring lines to see what dose to give him. I held the cup at eye level and poured the medicine in the cup. I checked to make sure it had the right amount and placed the cup back on the counter. I replaced the lid on the medicine. I took him the medicine and told him to drink it. He drank the medicine. I took the cup when he was done and washed it out. I put the cup back on top of the medicine bottle and took the bottle back to the bathroom. I opened the medicine cabinet and put it back in its place.On a hot summer day nothing is better then going to a swimming pool.  There is one at the community center by us so we can walk there.  Before we go, we get into our bathing suits and put on our flip flops.  We make sure to pack snacks, and towels and drinks into a bag, and grab a float and a ball to play with.  We walk to the pool, the hot day making us even more excited to going swimming.  Once there, we hurry to find empty lounge chairs to put our towels on and waste no time getting into the pool.  The water feels so cold at first, but its so refreshing.  We swim around and realize we have friends there.  We play a game with the ball for a while before getting out for snacks.  We dry out in the sun while we eat and drink and when we are hot again we get back into the water to swim some more.  Going to the swimming pool on hot days is the best way to stay cool and have fun too.Today I decided to clean up my flat where I live. I decided to start in my kitchen. I washed, dried and put away all of my dirty dishes, swept my kitchen floor and wiped down my counter tops and table. I also took out my garbage and put it at the end of my driveway for the garbage man to pick up. Then I moved onto my living room. I tidied up my couch and put away and miscellaneous items like books, blankets, snacks, etc. I then vacuumed my floor and dusted around my TV and bookshelf. The next room to clean was the bathroom. I used a toilet brush to scrub the inside of my toilet, and wiped down my sink and mirror. I put away any items that were left out, like toothpaste and face wash. I then used a sponge to scrub my bathtub and swept my tile floor. The last room to clean was my bedroom. I made my bed and put away my laundry. I dusted my shelves and the top of my dresser. Lastly, I vacuumed my floor. I was finally done and now had a clean flat!The garbage in the kitchen was getting too high and needed to be changed.   I had four clips on the top of the garbage bag which I unclipped .  Then I took the bag from the waste basket.  I pulled the bag out of the container carefully so that it did not spill.   I secured the bag at the top with the ties that came with the bag and I set it aside on the floor.   I went to the kitchen cabinet, opened it and took a new garbage bag out of the box.  I closed the cabinet door.  Then I went back to the empty wastebasket.  I fluffed out the new garbage bag so that it would fill properly.   I inserted it into the empty container and secure it with clips on all sides at the top.   Then I took the full garbage bag out to the car to carry to the town dumpsters.Today I wanted to read the newspaper, but I do not have a newspaper subscription.  I decided that the best way to get the newspaper would be to go to the library and read it there.  I got dressed, put on my bike helmet, and biked over to the local public library.  There, I went in and asked the library clerk where the daily newspapers were located.  She directed me to the third floor, where all of the periodicals and newspapers were kept.  I thanked her and went up the stairs to the third floor, seeing the newspapers held on large wooden sticks.  I found the newspaper I wanted, the New York Times, and took it over to a large empty reading table.  There, I scrolled through the pages that interested me, mainly the sports and politics sections, before returning the newspaper, exiting the library, and riding home on my bike.Mikey and his mom went to the Natural Museum of History this weekend.  While he was there , he saw many wonderful things.  At the museum, they had old giant bones of dinosaurs, wonderful movies of them, and lots of other wonderful animals there as well.  They even had lions and tiger bones, and Mikey was thrilled.  He spent all day looking at wonderful sites of nature, and how beautiful God's creation is.  He learned about conservation, and taking care of our planet.  He learned about the earth, the water and ocean, and even the skies and planets.  While he was there, they had a shop that you could buy toys and cards in.  He bought a gift for his brother and dad. One of the gifts was a dinosaur for his brother, and his dad got a world cup for coffee. His mother and him ate lunch there, and they got to see a movie of dinosaurs. They had a wonderful time.I was at home watching the baby while my wife was at work. I feed the baby and was just watching TV when I could tell that it was time to change the babies diaper. I went and got the diaper bag with everything that I would need to change the baby. I laid the baby down on the changing table and removed the old diaper and wiped down the baby to get her clean. Then I put some fresh powder on the baby and took out a new fresh diaper and put it on the baby. Now the baby was all fresh and clean and smelled really nice also.The baby was in a better mood after I changed her she was more at ease and happy because she was clean and feeling better. I always try to stay on top of changing the babies diaper because they feel better and it is better for them.Last weekend I woke up in a bad mood.  I went to make some coffee to wake me up.  I ground up the coffee.  The coffee grinder was loud and woke up my wife.  She asked me to make her some coffee too!  I had to grind up some more beans.  I put some filtered water in a microwave safe container.  I put the container into our microwave, which was three years old!  I had to heat up the water for six minutes because our microwave is not that fast.  I placed a filter on top of a coffee cup for my wife.  I filled the filter up with the coffee I had ground.  I tamped down the coffee grounds with my hand.  Then I carefully poured the hot water from the microwave over the coffee grounds.  I allowed the water to soak into the coffee grounds, and I allowed the grounds to come to rest in the filter.  Then I slowly poured more of the water into the grounds.  I gave my wife her cup of coffee when the water was done draining.My wife and I have been married for over 50 years and we aren't quite as athletic as we used to be. About once a month, however, my wife and I get bored and decide to do something we've been doing together since we met 50 long years ago. I dress up in one of my nicer suits and she puts on a dress in which she looks absolutely beautiful. We belong to a club that holds dance lessons every week so we sign up in advance and make our way there. Once we arrive we greet all of our old friends and get a short lesson on what we're to be learning that evening. Then, for about an hour or so, my wife and I dance with each other and some of our friends. We try to keep up with all the steps, but our old joints soon make us aware of our age. Even still, I would never give up the opportunity to dance.Today we are going to the mall! We jump in the van and drive to a really big building. The building is so big that there are lots and lots of spaces just so that all of the cars will have a place to park. We walk through some big sliding doors and head to a place that has lots of different types of foods. I smell pretzels and fruit, pizza and fried chicken, and perfumes from all of the different people. When he are done eating, we go to the clothing store. This store has lots of shoes and clothes. We try on lots of different shirts and jeans. Mother and I go to the cash register and talk to the pretty lady. She has really big earrings. Then mother pays her for our clothes and we go back out to the place where there are lots of things to eat. We go through the giant sliding doors again and head home.My friends and I wanted to make a camping trip. We first had to decide where to go. We picked a national park not very far away. We had to call and speak to the park ranger and arrange a spot to set up camp.Once we did, we began to plan the rest. We had to make sure we had the right equipment. We purchased a tent that was big enough for all of us and enough sleeping bags to sleep us all. We took some cast iron skillets from the kitchen, so we could cook with them. We also bought enough food. We bought food that would not go bad if it was not in a fridge. We bought lots of canned food. We also bought bottled water, enough to last the whole trip. We paced the clothes we would wear. We also packed all our gear. When we were sure we were ready, we headed out to the woods to go camping.Having pets requires a good amount of responsibility. One of the biggest responsibilities any pet owner has is making sure their pets are fed. This is the case for me and my cat. Just this morning, the first thing I did after waking up was feed him. The cat usually always has a way to tell me that he's hungry. If he doesn't jump onto my bead and brush up against my head, he'll meow very loudly while standing next to the pantry, where I keep the cans of food. Once I see that he's hungry and trying to tell me, I go over to the pantry and grab a can of cat food. I use a can opener to crack it open, and then I pour it into his bowl. I'll then watch him as he eats. He never leaves a single piece of food in his bowl, and always licks it clean.Last night , I booked my ticket to Boston .

I opened the garage door, put on my sunglasses, and grabbed a bottle of cold water. I gassed up the lawn mower with my portable gas tank. I pushed the mower into the yard where I normally started to mow. I cranked to mower, and on the third try it started. I pushed the mower back and forth throughout my yard, creating straight and conformed lines. Once I had completely mowed the front of my yard, I turned the mower off and took long drinks of my water. I then pushed the mower to the backyard and started it up again. Making straight lines in the grass, I completed the backyard, as well.

Sometimes it seems like a big chore, but once I start it does not seem that hard. I have a lot of throw rugs and pick them up first before cleaning the floor. I fold the rugs so that any dirt in them does not get on the floor. I like to sweep. I sweep all around the floor and even along the wall and corners of the room very well. I saw a spill mark in the kitchen and got a damp paper towel to clean up the mark. It took some scrubbing but finally came off the floor. I went outside to shack out my throw rugs. It was a nice day outside. I vacuumed my big rugs. Some of my floor needed to be mopped, so I did that and let the floors dry. I will try not to get the floors dirty.I wanted to talk to my friend so I had to write her a letter. I sat at my desk and took out a piece of paper and a pen. I wrote her name in the top corner of the paper and wrote about everything going on in my life right now. I told her about how my pets were doing, how work was, and even have much my life has improved. I asked her how she was doing and that I thought about her all the time. At the end of the letter I told her to contact me anytime and signed my name. After the letter was finished I had to get an envelope and stamp so I could mail it to her. I wrote on the envelope ours names and addresses. I put the stamp on the envelope and put it in the mailbox so it could be delivered. I could not wait for her to get it.My friend Steve and I had seen advertisements on television for a new movie that was coming out to the theaters.  We waiting until opening day, and went down that night to buy our tickets to watch the show.  We waited in line for several minutes before we were able to pay for our tickets.  Once we had our tickets we got in line to buy some snacks.  I ordered a large popcorn with extra butter and a large Coke.  Steve ordered a medium popcorn with butter, some peanut M&Ms and a large Dr. Pepper.  Once we had our snacks we handed over our tickets to the usher and walked into the theater.  We carefully scouted for just the right seats.  When we found the perfect seats, we sat down and watched the movie previews to see what new movies would soon be coming out.  Once the previews were over, the theater darkened and the movie began.Today I woke up and decided to make bacon and eggs for breakfast. I walked to the kitchen and got out all of the ingredient I needed, which included, eggs, bacon, cheese, onion, and green pepper. I placed a skillet on the burner to heat up, and cracked two eggs into a bowl. I threw away the shells and stirred them up until mixed. I also put the bacon in the frying pan and flipped each piece after several minutes. Once the bacon was cooked, I poured the veggies and egg mixture into the pan, stirring occasionally, until the mixture set up and was solid. Once cooked, I removed the eggs and placed them on a plate along with the bacon. I put the plate on the table and poured out a glass of orange juice to go with my meal. I also peeled an orange and set it on the plate. It was delicious!We had an emergency and needed to get help, so I decided I called 911. First I picked up the receiver to the phone and paste it to my ear to listen for a doubts home. Once I was sure that I heard the dial tone waiting for me to doubt a number, I pushed the number button labeled with the number 9 on the keypad, then I press the button with the number one on it  two times. I held the phone next to my ear and mouth, as I listened to the phone ring one time. He merely after that ring, the operator who worked as a dispatcher for the emergency center I was calling answered the phone on the other in, asking me what my emergency was. Speaking through the speaker piece of the telephone, I explained that we had an emergency and needed an ambulance to respond to our location immediately.Today is grocery day , I go every Thursday .

In order to calm him down, my dad went to the nearest hardware store to buy a brand new light bulb. He needed to make sure that the light bulb was the right size, so he took the old, burned out light bulb with him to compare. After finding the right size bulb, he paid for it and brought it back home. He then grabbed a nearby chair so that he could stand on to reach the empty socket where the bulb would go. He had me turn off the light switch, which would make sure that he would not get electrocuted while putting the bulb on or burned when it turns on. After less than 5 minutes, he is finished screwing in the bulb. We flip the switch to see if it works, and it does. My brother was now relieved. the zoo with her father and her two brothers.  Her father's name was Jared.  Her brothers' names were Logan and Tim.  They drove to the zoo in their car.  Before they arrived at the zoo, they stopped at a McDonald's and ate breakfast.  Natalie ate a biscuit.  Her brothers ate sausage and eggs.  Her father drank coffee.All three children loved the zoo.  Natalie's favorite animal was the gorilla.  She loved to watch him jump up and down.  She also liked it when he would pound on his chest and roar.  It was very exciting.  Logan's favorite animal was the giraffe.  He thought that it looked funny.  He also liked its spots.  Tim's favorite animal was the crocodile because it looked tough.Natalie, Logan, and Tim were not happy with the elephant.  He was their least favorite animal.  All he did was sleep in his cage.Natalie shouted, "Hey, Mr. Elephant, we want to see you up close!"  The elephant did not wake up.  She yelled a few more times, but the elephant kept sleeping.  She gave up and went to the next animal.The last animals that they saw were the penguins.  Natalie and her brothers thought that they were so cute.  Natalie asked to take one home, but her father said no.Ted was feeling happy as he looked into his bedroom mirror. He knew that tomorrow would be his birthday. Ted would be seven years old and his daddy was going to take him somewhere special.Ted's little brother Paul was playing with his alphabet blocks on the floor. Ted walked over and pat him on the shoulder. "Daddy said he's taking me to the new yogurt store," he told Paul. Paul is four years old so he asked Ted what a yogurt store was. "Yogurt is like ice cream," he told Paul, "and I'm going to get cherry." Paul said that he wanted cherry, too.Then Ted walked over to the closet. He looked at his favorite shirt and pants to wear tomorrow. Then he looked at his shiny black pair of shoes. He smiled because he would have a nice shirt, pair of pants, and pair of shoes to wear for his birthday.The two boys then heard the front door open and close. They raced down the stairs to greet their father. "Daddy, I'm ready for my birthday," Ted said. "Me too," said Paul. Their father laughed as he picked them up and carried them upstairs.Bill and Steve went to the park. It was a nice Saturday afternoon. They both rode their bicycles to the park. Bill and Steve were hoping to use the swings, but when they showed up, the swings were being used by Anne and Susan."Can we use the swings?" Bill asked the two girls, hoping they were almost done."Not now," said Anne. "We have only been here for a little bit."Bill was disappointed, but there were so many other things to do at the park. Bill and Steve went to the slide. Up and down they went, faster and faster, every time! It became a race, Bill and Steve ran back to the ladder as quickly as they could so they could go down again.After a half hour, the two boys were very tired from climbing the ladder and flying down the slide so quickly over and over. They went to their bikes to go back home. As they started going home, they saw Anne and Susan had left. They could use the swings before going home!It was almost Kira's birthday and Halloween. Kira wanted to paint pumpkins at the circus, but she was sick in bed. She had broken her leg earlier and now all of her leg hurt, even her toes. She had hurried when she had crossed the road, and slipped and ended up going to the hospital. Because she was not being careful enough, she was stuck in bed, eating crackers and watching television. Just as Kira was on her fourth hour of television, her mother knocked on her door. "Kira," she said. "Your friends are here." Kira looked up to see her two best friends, Lexie and Jamie. They were grinning. "Kira," Lexie said, "We got you something." When they entered, Kira saw that they had a giant pumpkin with them. Jamie was carrying a set of paints and paintbrushes. "Aww," Kira said. "Thank you, guys." "Duh," Lexie said. "What are friends for?"The birds chirped, the sun beat down on a nearby window, and the noisy sound of an alarm clock tried to let me know it was seven in the morning. Not only that, but the sound of a high pitched voice, announcing "It's here! It's here Janet, it's here!" That voice belonged to my sister, Karen. What she meant was that the day had finally come for our family trip to the nearby beach located beyond Eagle Point. She got our parents out of bed way before they were ready to be up, but they knew how much it meant to her so they put a smile on as mother made breakfast and father packed the family car with towels and umbrellas. We could barely hear him say how there wasn't much room for many items, but he fit it all together like every year. I warned him last go around to get something larger like a truck, or a van, even joking an airplane, but he stuck to his guns and stayed with cars.Truthfully, I had forgotten about the trip and made plans with my friends, Lauren and Matthew. As sad as I was to have to back out, I called the two of them and let them know of my mistake. They understood, and soon after we all entered the car and went on our way to the beach. The ride and the actual activities were pretty fun! We went swimming, met some new families, and got a little reading in. Karen wanted to play in the sand, but there was a piece of metal nearby so our mother wouldn't let her. Overall, we had a lot of fun and look forward to the next go around.A small boy named John was at the park one day.  He was swinging on the swings and his Tim friend played on the slide.  John wanted to play on the slide now.  John asked Tim if he could play on the slide.  Tim said no.  John was very upset and started crying.  A girl named Susan saw him crying. Susan told the teacher Ms. Tammy.  Ms. Tammy came over and told John that they could both take turns on the slide.  John and Tim were OK with this. They both took turns on the slide. They all lived happily ever after.A cat was watching a bird in a tree. The blue bird watched the cat as it tried to use its claws and climb up the tree. The cat reached the right branch and slowly walked towards the bird. The bird flew away and the cat was left stuck on the branch. The cat jumped down from the tall branch and didn't get hurt. He then chased after a chipmunk along the ground. The chipmunk was not faster than the cat, but the chipmunk ran up a tree. The cat tried to run up the tree, but fell back down. Not wanting to go back up a tree, the cat watched the chipmunk from the ground. It went into a hole in the tree and the cat gave up. The cat went under a house's deck to keep cool. It watched for more birds or chipmunks that it could chase after. He saw one chipmunk in the distance, then two three and four. He was ready to chase them.Once there was a white horse named Bob, who lived in a house with his best friend. His friend was a cat named Shelly who loved to play baseball. The two of them would go to the park and play baseball with Lucy a lamb who lived next door.It was Friday morning and Bob and Shelly were in the park waiting for Lucy. She was late and when she finally showed up she had forgotten the ball.They looked around. There were rocks but they were too hard. There could get mud out of the pond but that would be too soft and splat when they hit it with the wooden bat. Finally Bob, being the tallest, saw that in a pile of plants that there were melons growing."It'll work," said Bob, and he picked a melon and handed it to Shelly. "You pitch.""This is going to end badly, I'm afraid," Shelly said, throwing the melon at Bob who stood over home plate."I know what I'm doing," Bob said, swinging the bat as hard as he could. When the bat hit the melon it splatted into a million pieces, raining sticky pieces down on Bob and Shelly and Lucy and a wedding party that had been setting up nearby.There were many people at the store that day. This was because it was Saturday. It was even more full of people around noon when Mary and her mother went out to go shopping. In the store, Mary wanted her mother to buy her candy but Mary's mother was in a hurry. She did not have time for that. That is because she wanted to get home before it started to rain. Mary crossed her arms when her mother said no. Mary was sad that her mother would not get her any candy. But at home, her mother had a surprise for her. She told Mary to close her eyes. She thought it might be a toy. When she opened them again, she saw that her mother had baked her something. Her mother opened the oven. Inside was a cake. She jumped up in excitement. She didn't need to think how she felt. She was very happy. She did not want the candy now. She immediately took a big slice. She wasn't sure it she would eat it now. Then she ate it before she could make up her mind! Her smile then left her mouth. She quickly she became sad. Her mother had told her it was bedtime.Bob woke up to go to his first day of school on Monday. He woke up to his dog barking at him. His parents gave him a ride to school. When he arrived at school, he went to his first class which was gym class. In gym class, his gym teacher made him run laps around the track because he had been late to class.

After gym class was over, he went to English class. In English class, he read a story about a lady who had fallen in love with a kitty. One day the kitty jumped out of the window in the lady's house and never came back. The lady was sad and wondered why her kitty would leave her. Bob was very moved by the story. After English class was over, he went to his third class of the day which was math. Bob kept quiet in his math class because he didn't know the answers to most of the questions the teacher was asking. After his math class, he went to the fourth and last class of the day which was arts and crafts. In arts and crafts, Bob painted a picture that he was very proud of. When art class was over, Bob was happy because he had finished his first day of school. He was excited to go to school on Tuesday and Wednesday.Once, there was a boy named Dan that was no older then seven or eight years old.  Dan lived with his mother Sam and father Spike in a small house in a dangerous neighborhood in New York city.  Before their move from Florida he spent most of his time outside at a park. In fact they moved around a lot.  They have also lived in Georgia and California and this was the first time being stuck inside. It got so bad he was looking forward to going to school. This boy was an only child and was not allowed to go outside to play.  Instead he spent most of his time locked inside his house alone with no friends to play with.  One day he got a great idea.  Why don't I ask my mom, for a pet?  He thought long and hard.  I can get a dog or cat. I don't like birds, fish or hamsters. This way I'll always have a friend to play with when I'm inside.  He thinks to run up to his mom and say mommy, mommy!  Can I get a new pet?  His mom told him that if he wanted a pet that he would have to show her that he could take care of it.  She gave him chores and said, "if you can do these chores for one month I'll get you a dog."  Every evening before bed he would clear the table, clean the bathrooms and nicely stack all of the dishes.  His mother was in awe in the fact the she never had to tell him to complete his chore.  At the end of the month his mother kept her promise a got him a new puppy.  The boy was in love at first sight but the boy wasn't sure if the puppy looked like a Bob or a Rick.  Finally he yelled,  "I'm going to call him Rick!"Joe was in his bedroom. He was reading a book that his teacher gave him. The book was titled, "Everything You'd Want to Know About Fish." He was reading the book because he was interested in learning more about fish. Joe thought reading the book was fun. He liked to imagine himself swimming with fish he read about in the book. Also, he liked looking at the pictures.Joe's mother called him. Joe closed the book, and went downstairs. He asked his mother, "Do you need something?"I was really scared walking into school today. It was the first day of sixth grade and I was excited to be leaving elementary school, but I ended up going to a different middle school than all my friends since I moved across town last year. My name is Matt, but I'm going to try and not let anyone else know that as I'd rather sit in the back and keep to myself. I didn't want to ride the bus, so my mom said she would drive me there for today. Thankfully I found my classroom, but I walked in and saw nobody I knew, as I thought. I took a seat at an empty table as the teacher, Mrs. Frank took roll call. She seemed nice, and I'm happy we weren't told to sit in alphabetical order or by boys to boys and girls to girls, as I was free to sit by myself for now. Mrs. Frank called out Jimmy, Sally, Linda, Jason, and then finally got to my name in which I raised my hand quickly. As soon as she was done, a few of the kids who arrived late came to sit by me and said their names were Martin and Mark.Martin said he liked how our names all sounded the same, and Mark seconded that as we started talking before class began. When it was time to eat, we all said we would sit with one another in the lunch room, and also when it came to recess and playing together. It was nice to have some friends after being so nervous earlier, and see that everything does work out in the end. Hopefully soon we can all play together outside of class, but as far as today, it was a great start!A man sailed out to sea in a small boat. The sun was only rising, but this man liked spending all day fishing. A long way away from the shore, he stopped his boat. He pulled out his fishing pole and put some worms on the hook. He held it in the deep water and waited for a long time. After three hours there was still not a bite. The sun moved slowly across the sky. Morning turned into afternoon, and afternoon to evening. It was a slow day of fishing and he had to pack up. A fisherman does not give up so easy, even after many hours. It takes time to catch fish and fishing is not for people who give up quickly. The fisherman went home empty handed. He went home to his log cabin and sat by the fire. His stomach growled because there wasn't any dinner to eat tonight, but tomorrow would be a better day.One day, a boy named Sam went to the doctor because he fell and hurt his knee. He was riding his green tricycle in the yard when it happened. He played with yellow and red blocks in the waiting room before his visit with the doctor. His mother was sitting in a chair, reading a magazine and talking to other mothers sitting around her. The friendly nurse called Sam from the waiting room to finally visit the doctor. The nurse weighed Sam, measured his height, and asked him questions about the foods he had eaten that day. The nurse also took his temperature to make sure that he did not have a fever. After the nurse left the room, the doctor came in and asked Sam about his knee. Sam told the doctor all about his fall off the tricycle and the doctor wrote a lot of notes down. Doctors write a lot of notes so they can tell people like Sam more about their accidents. The doctor said, "Wow Sam! It sounds like you had quite a fall." The doctor put a bandage on his knee and gave him some medicine to take once he got home. On the way out of the doctor's office, Sam took a purple lollipop to eat on the car ride home. Sam's mom drove him back home, telling him to be careful for the next time that he plays outside. Sam's mom really cared about him and didn't like to see him get hurt.One day, Jimmy, who was getting ready to walk down to school, could not find his favorite hat. He began looking all over the place for it, his room, the kitchen, even outside. It was nowhere to be found. He was running late for school and didn't want to be marked absent so he went to school without it. At school, Jimmy kept becoming upset because he couldn't find his hat. When Jimmy got home his hat was sitting there next to his goldfish. His mom had found it. It was in the kitchen the whole time.Bill was cleaning his room and giving away some of the toys that he no longer used. Bill put a duck and a truck in the pile to give away. He added a car and a blanket and a push mower to the give a way pile. Bill liked the car and took it out of the give a way pile, so he did not give the car away. Bill put a broken phone into the trash can. Bill also threw away two books and some used crayons. As Bill was cleaning his room his mother came in to help. Bill and his mother cleaned most of the room. When they were almost finished Bill's father also came in to help. Bill picked up the duck and the truck and took it to the car. Bill's father picked up the blanket and the push mower and took them out to the car. Bill's mother carried the trash can down to the large garbage can outside. Bill's room was all cleaned.Little Tony was riding his bicycle all around the party. After all grandma gave him it right now. What fun would it be for Tony if he couldn't show off his new bike? He rode it up and down the hills and through the people at the party. It was his party. Everyone knew that it was his party. He was turning 8, 8 candles on the cake and the number 8 frosted on, the number 8 on his birthday hat. The big 8. It was much better than his last birthday. He didn't like being 7. He loved riding his bike closer and closer to people and things. Until he ran right into the big table with his birthday cake. All 8 candles flew all over the ground of the lawn. Tony was upset, and so was daddy at the big huge mess he made. He could have been more careful daddy said, and looked where he was going. He was right, Tony was being too crazy. But it was his party, so he kept riding, with more care this time. He rode his bike up and down. Faster and faster. Until Tony's birthday finally was over, long after it began.On a small farm outside of town, lived a boy named Curtis. Curtis was seven years old and he wanted to become an animal doctor someday. He always loved animals and helped take care of them on his family's farm.Curtis liked to feed the horses, chickens, pigs, dogs, and the cat. He also like to help take care of them when they got hurt or sick. Once, Curtis stayed in the barn all night, helping his father with a sick pony. The animal doctor was there too, and Curtis watched everything that he did. The doctor had to keep giving Bonnie the pony some medicine. And he kept checking her eyes and mouth.When the pony got better, the animal doctor went home. But Curtis and his father stayed in the barn with the pony until it became light outside. Curtis had gone to sleep, so his father carried him to their house and put him to bed.Curtis was so tired that even the smell of bacon from the kitchen didn't wake him up. Later, his father came and woke him. "Bonnie is going to be alright," he said to Curtis."Really?" the boy said as he rubbed his eyes, "I got to go check on her.""That can wait. Right now you need to eat something. I saved you some bacon, Mr. sleepy head," his father said as he smiled at Curtis.Curtis washed, dressed, and ate as fast as he could and then raced to the barn. He stood on a stool and looked into Bonnie's eyes and mouth. He put his head on her chest and listened to her heart. Then he checked her legs and tail. He tried to do everything the animal doctor did and more.Curtis saw his father standing at the door and said, "Everything looks okay, daddy. I think she can go out to the big tree with the other horses.""Okay, Dr. Curtis," his dad said as he patted Curtis on the back. "Let's take her outside."There is a large tree in a park where all the kids in the neighborhood can hang out and play.  The tree was planted in 1896 and has grown to over fifty feet tall with branches that were another thirty feet wide.  Next to the tree is a jungle gym.  The jungle gym has two slides, a fireman pole, a rock climbing wall, and much more.  One day the kids in the neighborhood came up with the idea of building a tree house so they could spend all of their time at the park, even when it was raining outside.  The children all went to their parents begging them to help and get wood.  The families of the neighborhood began building the master tree house.  Upon completion the tree house was ten by twelve feet high, with two windows, and plenty of space for the children to have fun.  Every day during the summer that year the children played in the park and went in the tree house from sunrise to sunset every day.  Fifteen years have gone by and the children are now too old to use the tree house.  The tree house still sits on the tree but instead has a new group of kids that get to enjoy the house.  Now the first kids have become parents and get to watch their idea live on and make the children of the neighborhood happy.Jane was a dog who lived all alone, in a broken freezer in a dump. There was all kinds of junk in the dump, from a car, to a wooden cow, to a clock, but Jane's favorite thing she had was a giant sock. Jane was always chewing at the sock, and kept it with her in her freezer. When Jane was not chewing on the sock, she was running around in the dump, looking for things to eat, or things that were fun to sniff, or that she could bark at. Still, even when Jane was having fun doing other things, her favorite thing of all to do was chew on her giant sock. Sometimes Jane would see other animals in the dump. There were always birds around, as well as sometimes a snake, and once even a cat. A deer even came through once. Jane was quick to start barking at the cat, and she quickly scared it away and it never came back. The birds were something that Jane was always trying to catch. She was never fast enough, they would always fly far away before Jane even got close. But that didn't stop Jane from barking at them whenever she saw them. Jane liked being active. Even when Jane was all alone, she was active. Jane was a happy dog.Josie could hear the birds singing outside the classroom window.  She could see some of them sitting on the branches of an apple tree.  Mrs. Harper checked to see if everyone was present.  Each child called out when they heard their name.  She then asked for a volunteer to read a story about a family of grasshoppers.  Many hands were raised but she picked Josie's friend, Mary.  While Mary was reading the story, she got a tickle in her throat. She began to cough.  Mrs. Harper told her to go get some water to drink and a boy named Henry finished the story.  Next, Mrs. Harper showed the class a butterfly garden.  Someone asked if butterflies ate other bugs.  Mrs. Harper said that butterflies don't eat but only drink.  Josie was chosen to pass out turkey sandwiches for lunch.  Mrs. Harper went to the refrigerator.  She got out some vanilla yoghurt for each of the boys and girls.  All the students cheered.John is five years old and loves the ocean. When he is in the tub, John pretends that he is a sailboat racer. He always wins. Sometimes John stays in the tub too long.

One time Tiger accidentally lit a bush on fire when he was playing with a looking glass and the bush burned to the ground. Tabby was very mad and Tiger blamed it on Tom. Tabby believed Tiger, because she thought Tom was a trouble maker. One time Tabby took a trip to the ocean and she took Tiger, but not Tom. Tom was very upset, but acted like he didn't want to go. Tom said he would rather go to the forest, the moon or the mountains, but never would he go to the ocean. This wasn't true, but Tom didn't want to let Tiger and Tabby know that they hurt him. When Tabby and Tom went to the ocean, their uncle Leon came to visit and to take care of Tom. Tom had never met Leon before. Leon loved Tom and made him feel very special.

He worked at Santa's factory, baking cakes with lots of frosting. He didn't like making cake much. In fact, Isaac's dream was to work in the factory with the elves making toys. But since he was a frog, he was never allowed to build toys with the elves. One day, he got a smart idea. He would dress up as an elf and sneak into the factory, hoping no one would find out.

The teacher was writing on the chalkboard as she spoke.  She was very happy to be teaching the children more vocabulary words to use.  Then they could read more books.  The teacher thought reading was always a very fun activity. While thinking, Sue planned how she would climb the tall tree in the playground.  It had many low, thick branches.  She wanted to see what the yard looked like from up above.  She did not think reading was a very fun activity at all.  She would rather be outside. Bob took lots of notes on what the teacher was saying.  He also copied down everything she wrote.  He was very proud of his notes.  If the other students ever needed help, he was glad give it to them. He thought reading the books people his age told him to read boring.  However, he loved borrowing books from his older sister.

One of the games was for fire-building. The point of the game was to help teach campers how to best build fires. There are many different ways you can build a campfire. You can build a lean-to campfire. You can also build a teepee fire. To build the fires you must find and sort different sizes of sticks and brush and larger logs to get the fire going. The goal of the game is to build a fire big enough to burn a string that is hanging a few feet above the ground. My group was falling behind, so I gave the idea of throwing a bunch of leaves on the fire all at once to make a huge fire to quickly burn the string. We were not allowed to win the game because it was said we cheated.Once there was a turkey named Tim, who enjoyed playing house, playing football and riding his bicycle all the time.
